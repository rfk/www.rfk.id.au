   <p>I am a freelance software developer and consultant living in Melbourne, Australia.  The best way to contact me is by email:</p>
  <p><span class="email-addr">&#114;ya&#110;&#64;&#114;&#102;&#107;&#46;&#105;d&#46;&#97;u</span></p>

  <p>Professionally, I have worked as a programmer and system administrator for the better part of the last decade.  I am particularly experienced with the Python programming language, which I have used to develop both web-based and desktop applications. I also enjoy logic programming using languages such as Prolog and Mozart.</p>

  <p>Academically, I have completed a PhD in Computer Science with the Intelligent Agents Laboratory at the University of Melbourne.  My undergraduate studies were a double bachelor's degree in Engineering and Computer Science, which I was awarded with first class honours.  If you're interested in logical approaches to reasoning about knowledge, action and change, you might enjoy a <a href="/ramblings/research/">summary of my research</a> and a browse through my <a href="/ramblings/research/">published papers</a>.</p>

  <p>Personally, I enjoy public speaking, theatre and performance arts of any persuasion.  I am a keen hiker and camper, even though it means being disconnected from the Internet for days at a time.</p>
