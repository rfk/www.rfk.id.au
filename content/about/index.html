<p>I am a software developer and occasional consultant living in Melbourne, Australia.  I've been programming for over twelve years and will be doing it for many more to come.  These days I work mostly in Python, but I've done serious projects in PHP, JavaScript, Prolog and Mozart, and like to dabble in many other languages; I even have a few ideas for a new language of my own design, but that's a story for another day...</p>

<p>Academically, I have a PhD in Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.unimelb.edu.au/">University of Melbourne</a>, completed under the supervision of <a href="http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/~adrian/">Dr Adrian Pearce</a> and affiliated with the <a href="http://www.agentlab.unimelb.edu.au/">Intelligent Agents Laboratory</a>.  If you're interested in logical approaches to reasoning about knowledge, action and change, you might enjoy a <a href="/ramblings/research/">summary of my research</a> and a browse through my <a href="/ramblings/research/">published papers</a>.  Prior to this I completed a Bachelor of Engineering (Mechatronics) with Honours and a Bachelor of Computer Science, also at the University of Melbourne.</p>
