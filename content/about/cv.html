  <h2><a name="employment">Employment History</a></h2>

  <h3>Director/Lead Developer, Cloud Matrix
  <span class="details">July 2009 to Present</span></h3>
  <p>I am currently co-director and lead developer at <a href="http://www.cloudmatrix.com.au/">Cloud Matrix</a>, a small Melbourne-based startup in the cloud storage space.  We build <a href="http://www.saltdrive.com/">SaltDrive</a>, an encrypted cloud-enabled USB stick.  The SaltDrive technology stack is all built using Python, including the server-side file storage, client-side interface, and website.</p>


  <h3>Freelance Developer and Consultant
  <span class="details">November 2008 to Present</span></h3>
  <p>I currently do occasional work as a freelance developer and software consultant.  My past projects have involved developing Python-based desktop and online applications, and code maintenance and translation services for Prolog.</p>


  <h3>Programmer, The Victorian Partnership for Advanced Computing
  <span class="details">March 2004 to November 2008</span></h3>
  <p>After completing my Summer Internship with the Victorian Partnership for Advanced Computing, I undertook ongoing programming work on a casual basis.  My roles have ranged from developer to software architect, handling the design and development of software for engineering applications.</p>

 <p>Most recently, I was the lead architect and developer for a web-based project management portal used to coordinate research and development activities among several large organisations.</p>


  <h3>Casual Tutor, The University of Melbourne
  <span class="details">July 2005 to June 2006</span></h3>
  <p>While studying for my PhD, I undertook two semesters of casual teaching work in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at the University of Melbourne.  I tutored the subject "Algorithms and Data Structures" and was a lab demonstrator for the subject "Logic and Computation".  Duties included preparing and running both tutorial sessions and practical programming sessions, along with assessment of assignments and marking of exams.</p>
  <p>As a result of significant positive feedback from both students and faculty, in 2006 I was awarded an "Excellence in Tutoring" award from the department.</p>

  <h3>Computational Engineer, The Victorian Partnership for Advanced Computing
  <span class="details">December 2003 to February 2004</span></h3>
  <p>In late 2003 I was selected to undertake a Summer Internship with the Victorian Partnership for Advanced Computing.  This was a paid position which involved developing a piece of engineering software for use in the organisation's computational engineering projects.  The project involved heavy use of the Python programming language, which as since become my favourite language for general development work.</p>

  <h3>IT Manager, Whitley College
  <span class="details">January 2003 to December 2004</span></h3>
  <p>This position was a formalisation of many aspects of the volunteer role I had played at Whitley College in previous years.  As IT Manager I was responsible for coordinating technical support for the College's residents and academic staff, evaluating and implementing new technologies for the campus network, and liaising with student volunteers and with the College's Board of Directors.</p>
  <p>I also filled the role of Project Manager and Lead Developer during an overhaul of the College's public website.</p>

  <h2><a name="languages">Programming Languages</a></h2>

  <p>I enjoy programming languages of any shape or form, and have a passing familiarity with many including Java, C++, Haskell, Perl and Lisp.  I have listed below only those in which I consider myself fluent.</p>

  <h3>Python</h3>
  <h3><span class="details">Skill Level:  Expert</span></h3>

  <p>Python is currently my language of choice for general-purpose development, as shown by its prevalence among my current <a href="/software/">open-source software projects</a>.  Like many Pythonistas, I appreciate the language's simplicity and its elegant conceptual model.  I've come to depend on Python's comprehensive standard library and the great variety of software available on the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/">Python Package Index</a> to get things done quickly and easily.</p>
  <p>However, there are a few things I miss from other languages &ndash; anonymous function definitions, logic variables, and futures being the main offenders.  I have a secret plan to copy Mozart's first-class computation spaces into Python, if I ever find enough contiguous free time to do so.</p>

  <p>My most popular open-source Python projects include:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/rfk/esky/">Esky</a>:  an auto-update framework for frozen Python apps</li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/rfk/promise">Promise</a>:  a Python bytecode optimiser</li>
  <li><a href="/software/pyenchant/">PyEnchant</a>:  a suite of bindings for the Enchant spell-checker library</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>JavaScript</h3>
  <h3><span class="details">Skill Level:  Advanced</span></h3>

  <p>JavaScript was the first programming language I ever learned and I have been using it sporadically for over ten years.  Aside from the obvious list of warts and browser incompatibilities, I find JavaScript to be very powerful and highly productive language, and I'm looking forward to its increasing adoption as a general-purpose tool.</p>

  <p>My most popular open-source JavaScript projects include:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/rfk/xmlns/">jquery.xmlns</a>:  a jQuery plugin providing CSS-3 namespace selector syntax</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>C</h3>
  <h3><span class="details">Skill Level:  Advanced</span></h3>

  <p>While I rarely choose to develop in C unless execution speed is of the utmost importance, my involvement with open-source projects ensures I have sufficiently regular exposure to the language to maintain a comfortable familiarity.  I also taught an algorithms and data structures class using C as the implementation language, so I have significant experience at reading a wide variety of C code &ndash; from the very good to the very hard to decipher.</p>

  <p>My most popular open-source C projects include:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/rfk/tnetstring/">tnetstring</a>:  a data serialisation language, similar in spirit to JSON but easier to parse and render.</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>Prolog</h3>
  <h3><span class="details">Skill Level:  Advanced</span></h3>

  <p>I have used Prolog throughout my academic career, as it is the language of choice for research in symbolic artificial intelligence.  I also taught Prolog to undergraduate students for two semesters, an experience I thoroughly enjoyed.  My sentiments on Prolog echo those of ESR on Lisp: learning Prolog will make you a better programmer, even if you don't use it for your day-to-day programming.   And let's face it, most people probably <i>shouldn't</i> use Prolog for their day-to-day programming &ndash; but for problems that fit within Prolog's domain of expertise, it's hard to beat.</p>

  <p>I have no open-source projects in Prolog, but the work from my PhD thesis is a good example of my skillset:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.rfk.id.au/ramblings/research/thesis/MIndiGolog0.tar.gz">MIndiGolog0</a>:  an offline planning system for the MIndiGolog language</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.rfk.id.au/ramblings/research/thesis/PKnows-0.9.9.tar.gz">PKnows</a>:  a reasoning platform for complex epistemic modalities such as common knowledge</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>PHP</h3>
  <h3><span class="details">Skill Level:  Competent</span></h3>
  <p>I have used PHP for professional web development for over 5 years.  Like many developers who also work in other dynamic languages, I have an uneasy but stable truce with PHP &ndash; while I bemoan its gratuitous lack of elegance and its hollow mockery of a meta-programming system, I have a deep respect for its ability to get things done fast on the web, and am more than happy to adopt it when it's the right tool for the job.</p>

  <p>I have no open-source projects in PHP; it's not my first choice when programing for fun.</p>


  <h3>Mozart</h3>
  <h3><span class="details">Skill Level:  Competent</span></h3>

  <p>Mozart is a multi-paradigm programming language with some incredibly powerful features.  In my thesis I used its strong support for distributed logic programming to implement a planning system that automatically distributes its workload across a team of agents.  More than any other language, Mozart has introduced me to features that I now wish I could use everywhere - examples include dataflow synchronisation, futures, lightweight micro-threads, and first-class computation spaces.<p>

  <p>I have no open-source projects in Mozart, but the work from my PhD thesis is a good example of my skillset:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.rfk.id.au/ramblings/research/thesis/MIndiGolog1-0.9.9.tar.gz">MIndiGolog1</a>:  an online distributed planning system for the MIndiGolog language</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.rfk.id.au/ramblings/research/thesis/MIndiGolog2-0.9.9.tar.gz">MIndiGolog2</a>:  an offline, distributed, asynchronous planning system for the MIndiGolog language</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="personal">Personal Interests</a></h2>

  <p>Outside of computer science, my interests include the following:</p>

  <p><b>Public Speaking: </b> I have completed 2 years of training in Effective Communication, and area encompassing public speaking and general communications skills.  I achieved a pass with distinction (91%) in Grade Four of the Trinity College London Effective Communication Examination, an internationally-recognised award.  I enjoy debating and during my residence was  a long-standing member of the Whitley College debating team.</p>

  <p><b>Theatre:</b> I have had major roles in a number of amateur theatrical/musical productions include <i>Into the Woods</i>, <i>Cosi</i>, <i>The Baker's Wide</i> and <i>Bugsy Malone</i>.  I also enjoy impromptu theatre and I am a keen participant in theatrical challenges such as Theatre Sports.</p>

  <p><b>Hiking and Camping:</b> I have a growing interest in hiking, camping, and related outdoor activities, and have been exploring local Victorian attractions such as the Grampians, Croajingolong National Park, and most recently a five-day hike through Wilson's Promontory.  Free-time-pending, I hope to expand my horizons in the near future by hiking Tasmania's Overland Trail.</p>
