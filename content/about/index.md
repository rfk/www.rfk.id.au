## Ryan F. Kelly

I am a software developer and occasional consultant.  I live in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverloch,_Victoria">seaside village</a> near Melbourne, Australia and currently work remotely for <a href="https://www.mozilla.com/">Mozilla</a>.  The best way to contact me is by email:</p>
  <p><span class="email-addr">ryan@rfk.id.au</span></p>

Professionally, I have worked as a programmer and system administrator for over a decade.  I am particularly experienced with the Python programming language, which I have used to develop both web-based and desktop applications.  I also have substantial experience with JavaScript and enjoy logic programming using languages such as Prolog and Mozart.

Academically, I have completed a PhD in Computer Science with the Intelligent Agents Laboratory at the University of Melbourne.  My undergraduate studies were a double bachelor's degree in Engineering and Computer Science, which I was awarded with first class honours.  If you're interested in logical approaches to reasoning about knowledge, action and change, you might enjoy a <a href="/ramblings/research/">summary of my research</a> and a browse through my <a href="/ramblings/research/">published papers</a>.

Personally, I enjoy public speaking, theatre and performance arts of any persuasion.  I am a keen hiker and camper, even though it means being disconnected from the Internet for days at a time.
