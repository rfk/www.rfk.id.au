title = "Ryan F. Kelly"

I am a software engineer and occasional consultant.  I live in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverloch,_Victoria">seaside town of Inverloch</a> near Melbourne, Australia,
where I work remotely as a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://harrison.ai/">harrison.ai</a>.

The best way to contact me is by email; use `ryan@` plus the domain of this website.

Professionally, I have worked as a software engineer for over a decade. I have substantial experience with Python, JavaScript, and Rust, but will confidently dabble in just about any language.
I've worked at scale across the stack, from back-end services to webapps to native clients, and have even spent a few years in management. I sometimes write about those experiences on [my blog](/blog).

Academically, I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the Intelligent Agents Laboratory at the University of Melbourne. My undergraduate studies were a double bachelor's degree in Engineering and Computer Science, which I was awarded with first class honours.  If you're interested in logical approaches to reasoning about knowledge, action and change, you might enjoy a reading <a href="/ramblings/research/">more about my research</a>.

Personally, I enjoy public speaking, theatre and performance arts of any persuasion.  I am a keen hiker and camper, even though it means being disconnected from the Internet for hours or even days at a time.
