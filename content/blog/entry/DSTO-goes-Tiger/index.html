{% mark excerpt %}<p>According to The Age, the <a href="http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au/">Defense Science and Technology Organiation</a> has spent <a href="http://theage.com.au/articles/2005/05/02/1114886287215.html?from=rss">almost $90,000 on Apple Xserves</a> running the newly released OSX Tiger.  I love the justification given for this hardware/software combination: "Grunty".</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, it sounds like the computers will be used for research into planning and decision-making agent software using a chess-playing metaphor.  The <a href="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/agentlab">Agentlab</a> at Melbourne Uni (of which I am now a part!) has done work with DSTO in the past.  Not the stuff that I'm working on though...</p>{% endmark %}
