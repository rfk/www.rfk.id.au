{% mark excerpt %}<p>So you might have noticed a few changes around here - a completely new website, for example.  They correspond with some exciting changes for me in real life.</p>
<p>First, the <a href="/ramblings/research/">thesis</a> has been submitted for examination. I've entered a wonderful new phase of my research known as "waiting to hear back", which should last for at least six months.  I'm also working on turning some of the thesis chapters into stand-alone journal papers. But it finally frees me to explore a few of the other things that I have been keeping on the back-burner for over a year now.</p>
<p>Second, I have left my job at <a href="http://www.vpac.org/">VPAC</a> and am now devoting all of my energies to (1) developing my own software projects, and (2) freelancing to pay the bills.  I'm sure I'll have more to say on that front as things develop over the next few weeks...</p>{% endmark %}
