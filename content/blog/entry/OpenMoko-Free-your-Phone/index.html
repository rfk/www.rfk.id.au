{% mark excerpt %}<p>For a good couple of years now, I've been telling myself (and anyone 
else who would stand still long enough) that I'm not upgrading my phone 
because I'm waiting for a Linux SmartPhone.  And waiting.  And waiting. 
Well, looks like it's finally time to put my money where my mouth is:</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.openmoko.com/">OpenMoko Neo1973</a> is on sale.</p>

<p>This is an open mobile platform in the truest sense - open source software 
stack, hackable hardware, and at US$300 for the base version it's priced 
within reach of a good-sized community.  Like most devices in the mobile space 
at the moment, it's drawing a lot of comparisons to the iPhone.  Unlike most 
devices, it's actually getting a few hits in - it's <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2152759,00.asp">being</a> 
<a href="http://www.lastpodcast.net/2007/06/28/openmoko-the-anti-iphone/">touted</a> as the
<a href="http://www.libervis.com/article/forget_iphone_hail_openmoko_the_true_revolution">anti</a>-<a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/smartphones/first-look-the-antiiphone-openmokos-neo1973-236841.php">iPhone</a>
 thanks to its robustly open nature.</p>

<p>Now, a very big caveat: the device currently on sale is basically a "developer
release".  It works, kinda, but software-wise leaves <a href="http://www.vanille-media.de/site/index.php/2007/07/11/neo-1973-phase-1-started/">a lot to be desired</a>.  The mass-market
release is due in October and will offer significant hardware upgrades (including
Wifi and dual accelerometers) and more polished software.  Nonetheless, my order
is in and the end of my long wait is in sight.  <a href="http://www.openmoko.com">Free
