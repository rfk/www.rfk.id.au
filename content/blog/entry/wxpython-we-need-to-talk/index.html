<p>wxPython, we need to talk.</p>

<p>We've had some great times together, but lately I've been feeling more and more frustrated by our relationship.  I don't seem to understand you the way I think I should, and you no longer seem to understand me the way I remember.  Why, just last week I found myself walking the <i>entire widget tree</i> and calling setMinSize() on everything just to get the layout to adjust itself correctly after a change.  Let's face it, that's not healthy.  Has it always been like this between us?  A battle of odd hacks and workarounds?</p>

<p>Maybe it's me.  After all, we've spent many years together and I don't remember being anything but happy.  Maybe my needs have changed.  Maybe I never took the time to <i>really</i> understand you in the way that you deserve.  But you've changed as well.  I remember our carefree early days using wx.ADJUST_MINSIZE to get layouts behaving just so, but now <a href="http://old.nabble.com/Patch-to-wx2.9-trunk-for-wxADJUST_MINSIZE-td19650919.html">it's a no-op</a>.  You say it has become the default behaviour?  Then why am I walking widget trees and adjusting the min size by hand?  Whatever the cause, it's clear that there's something wrong between us.</p>

<p>wxPython, there's no point in beating around the bush &ndash; I've found <a href="http://www.pyside.org/">someone else</a>.  Someone who understands my needs, and who makes herself <a href="http://www.pyside.org/docs/pyside/">easy to understand</a> in return.</p>

<p>She automatically resizes her layout managers when I change the widgets inside them; better yet, she does it recursively. She double-buffers all drawing by default, so that I don't have to resort to <a href="http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Flicker-Free_Drawing">strange paint-event voodoo</a> to reduce flickering to an acceptable level.  And her interface builder?  <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/4.7/designer-manual.html">The best I've seen</a>.</p>{% endmark %}

<p>Oh, I know it won't be all champagne and roses.  I'm already missing the years of pythonisation that have gone into your API.  I miss <a href="http://wiki.wxpython.org/CallAfter">wx.CallAfter</a>.  I miss <a href="http://wxpython.org/docs/api/wx.py-module.html">wx.py</a>.  I miss your careful refactoring of C++ namespaces and prefixes into a sensible python module structure.   I don't like the way she makes me instantiate <a href="http://www.pyside.org/docs/pyside/PySide/QtCore/QEvent.html#PySide.QtCore.QEvent.Type">various</a> <a href="http://www.pyside.org/docs/pyside/PySide/QtCore/QIODevice.html?highlight=qiodevice#PySide.QtCore.QIODevice.OpenModeFlag">subclasses</a> of int to satisfy an invisible type system.  And it's hard for me to leave behind my old <a href="http://www.rfk.id.au/software/XRCWidgets/">familiar</a> <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/wxAnyThread/">toolset</a>.

<p>But many of these things can be fixed or worked around, given time.  I can <a href="http://www.github.com/rfk/pysidekick">rebuild my toolset</a>.  And frankly, for the end results I'm seeing in the time it's taking to get them, I can change.</p>

<p>You'll always have a special place in my heart, but it's time for me to move on.  I'm leaving you.</p>
