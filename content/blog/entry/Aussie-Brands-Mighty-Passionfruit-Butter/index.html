{% mark excerpt %}<p>In the proud tradition of <a href="http://www.rfk.id.au/blog/entry/66">MightyMite</a>, Three Threes brings us another funny-coloured spreadable paste: <a href="http://www.threethrees.com.au/prod/mighty_03.html">Mighty Passionfruit Butter</a>.  You might expect a man who names his computers after tropical fruits to be pretty excited about this product.  You would be correct.  I was puzzled how I could possibly have been unaware of its existence for 25 years, until I googled it for this post and realized that it's <a href="http://www.threethrees.com.au/prod/newproducts.html">brand new</a>.</p>
<p>Short review: I love it!  Read on for more, and the breakfast recipe we had this morning.</p>
<ul><li>Tip #1: don't judge this product by its smell.  I opened the jar and took a big whiff, hoping to be smacked in the face with passionfruity goodness.  Nope.  I was rewarded only with the disappointing scent of stale butter.  Weird, but push ahead.</li>
<li>Tip #2: spread thinly. Once it gets in your mouth, the desired passionfruity goodness smack <b>will</b> be delivered.</li></ul>
<p>I had high hopes for this spread and I was not let down.  Strong, tangy passionfruit taste - what more could I ask for?  (I suppose I could ask for "healthy treat", but  taking a look at the ingredients list that's probably a bit much...)</p>
<p>Here's a little recipe (if you can call it that) Lozz and I picked up in a caravan park in Port Douglas, that alerted us to the existence of this product:</p>
<p><b>Easy Tropical Pancakes</b></p>{% endmark %}
<ol>
<li>Purchase a jar of <a href="http://www.threethrees.com.au/prod/mighty_03.html">Three Threes Mighty Passionfruit Butter</a> and a small can of <a href="http://www.goldencircle.com.au/">Golden Circle</a> coconut cream (hey, this <i>is</i> a post about Aussie Brands).</li>
<li>Prepare pancakes according to your favourite recipe (or just <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=pancake+recipe">google for one</a>), replacing some of the milk with the coconut cream.</li>
<li>Spread with passionfruit butter, close eyes, imagine the sun on your shoulders and a fresh tropical breeze blowing through your hair, enjoy.</li>
