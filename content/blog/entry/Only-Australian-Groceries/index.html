{% mark excerpt %}<p>It's amazing the things you can discover when you're supposed to be studying.  <a href="http://www.onlyoz.com.au/">Only Australian Groceries</a> is an on-line supermarket dedicated to stocking only Australian-owned and Australian-made products.  There are a lot of products listed that I have <b>never</b> seen on supermarket shelves, more's the pity.  Interestingly, delivery is made using the standard Australia Post parcel service.</p>
<p>Sadly, I dont think even I'm ready for online grocery shopping just yet, especially since I still need to pop across to BiLo for milk.  However, I've already found it to be a great guide to which products to buy in a regular bricks-and-mortar supermarket.</p>{% endmark %}
