{% mark excerpt %}<p>An interesting perspective from Melbourne Indymedia on the Schapelle Corby case as it relates to the wider world: <a href="http://melbourne.indymedia.org/news/2005/05/92141.php">Don't Blame Indonesia</a>.  Quote:</p>
<p><i>
While most Australians sympathise with Schapelle Corby and her family, let's remind ourselves that she is just one of some 200 Australian citizens serving long sentences or awaiting trial in foreign prisons for alleged drug-trafficking. Many are facing the death penalty if convicted. Where is the compassion and the sympathy for them? Corby, who has captured the hearts and minds of all Australians, is far better off than the current three Australians facing execution in Singapore and Vietnam.
