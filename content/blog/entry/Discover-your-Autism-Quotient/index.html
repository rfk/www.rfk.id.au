{% mark excerpt %}<p>It is a well-known law of the Internet that:  <i>For all X, there exists a website that allows you to "Discover your X!"</i>.  Unfortunately most values of X are stupid, such as "canine personality" (I am a great dane) and "inner TV star" (be stuffed if I can remember my result).  Here's one that's actually mildly interesting: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/modules/newsweek/autism_quotient/default.asp">Discover your Autism Quotient</a>.</p>
<p>Warning: It requires flash.  I feel dirty posting it.</p>
<p>Apprently 11-22 is average, 23-31 is above average, and above 31 there's probably a medical term for your condition.  My score was 26.  This is not surprising considering my answers to some of the questions, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am fascinated by numbers</li>
<li>It does not upset me if my daily routine is disturbed</li>
<li>
I have to plan any activities I participate in carefully</li>
</ul>
<p>No prizes for guessing how I answered those.</p>{% endmark %}
