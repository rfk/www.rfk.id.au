{% mark excerpt %}<p>As a some-time web developer, it's my duty to pass this on as much as possible: Paul Thurrott calls for users to <a href="http://www.windowsitpro.com/Article/ArticleID/47208/47208.html">Boycott Internet Explorer 7</a>, the new version of IE soon to come out of Microsoft.  What makes this special is that Paul isnt an open-source advocate or Microsoft basher, he's a mild-mannered reporter for a Windows news site.</p>
<p>The reason?  Microsoft's continued disregard for <a href="http://www.w3c.org">web standards</a> makes developing websites a harrowing ordeal, and viewing websites a hit-and-miss affair.  They are the only browser developer not "playing nice" on the internet today.</p>
<p>Of course, those of us not running Windows XP wont have much choice but to join in this boycott, as IE7 wont be available for older versions of Windows.</p>{% endmark %}
