{% mark excerpt %}<p>I have just returned from one of the most surreal experiences of my life - being a special guest on <a href="http://www.rrr.org.au/">Triple R FM Radio</a>.  I appeared in my capacity as a "freelance technology consultant" to offer some opinions and advice on computing platforms.  I took the opportunity to plug <a href="http://www.apple.com.au/">Apple and OSX</a> and try to offer a bit of advice on general computer issues.  Sadly, I couldnt bring myself to tell radio listeners that they should all be switching to <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Linux.</a>  Maybe I just haven't found the right <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">distro for the "masses"</a> just yet...?</p>
<p>The program was part of <a href="http://www.rrr.org.au/onair.php?pid=3">Room With A View</a>, a segment showcasing the talents of RMIT media students.  And, of course, I happen to be mates with an RMIT media student who is interested in computers.</p>

<p>There's nothing quite like the disturbing experience of hearing your own voice played back at you...</p>{% endmark %}
