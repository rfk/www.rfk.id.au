{% mark excerpt %}<p>Since it's been in the news lately with the latest <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/01/11/1136956241019.htm">Kraft</a> <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/01/12/1136956302258.html">scandal</a>, I thought it's high time to trot out a few entries I've been meaning to do on "Aussie Brands".  First on the list is the most Australian replacement for our most Australian of foodstuffs: <a href="http://www.threethrees.com.au/prod/mighty.html">MightyMite</a>.</p>
<p>When I first went shopping for an Aussie substitute, I was <i>really, really</i> hoping to find some sort of "Dick-Mite".  Alas, this particular Dick Smith product seems to have disappeared.  Instead there was MightyMite, which helpfully has both a big australian flag on it, and the "Australian Made and Owned" logo.  MightyMite is manufactured by <a href="http://www.threethrees.com.au/">Three Threes</a>, an all-Aussie company of the <a href="http://businessnetwork.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/08/995.html">highest regard</a>.  They also make great olives and gherkins, and are in fact one of my favourite brands.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people who swear they could never leave Vegemite behind.  I've always been a Promite man myself, but I know how disconcerting it is to be faced with a different black paste on your toast.  I'm here to tell you, MightyMite may be different but it's <b>good</b>.  Give it  a shot :-)</p>
<p>The first thing you'll notice about MightyMite is that it's thinner than Vegemite - both in texture and taste.  Vegemite is a solid dry black, MightyMite is moister and more of a dark brown.  My first thought was that it looked a little sicklier than similar products.  But that's only appearances.  I find this makes it easier to spread than Vegemite, particularly for me because I dont use butter.</p>{% endmark %}
<p>It's definitely got that "black paste taste", but it's a little milder than Vegemite and doesnt make your cheeks hurt in quite the same way.  Of course, it is a "rich source of Vitamin B" and is also high in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folate">folate</a>, which the media has convinced me will be useful when I get pregnant, but is actually very good the rest of the time as well.
</p>
<p>Do I seriously expect to talk anyone off of Vegemite?  No, not really.  But after several months I am well and truly a MightyMite convert, so the least I can do is a little publicity.</p>
