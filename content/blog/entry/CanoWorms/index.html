{% mark excerpt %}<p>Last week I finally got around to something I've been considering for more than two years now - Lozz and I set up a worm farm in our back yard.</p>
<p>It's a <a href="http://www.graigfarm.co.uk/wormery.htm">Can-O-Worms</a> model, designed and built right here in Australia from 100% recycled plastic.  Once the worms are properly established, they should easily be able to consume all of our organic waste and the end product will keep our fast-growing veggie garden in tip-top shape.</p>
<p>There's not much action in the farm at the moment, I think the worms are still a little shell-shocked after their transplanation.  But if you want to see what it <b>should</b> look like when the action starts, check out the photos on this <a href="http://petworms.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_petworms_archive.html">PetWorms Blog</a>.</p>{% endmark %}
