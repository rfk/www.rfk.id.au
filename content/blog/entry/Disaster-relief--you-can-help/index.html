{% mark excerpt %}<p>I'm sure you've heard about it by now - over <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/World/Sri-Lankan-tsunami-toll-jumps-to-11500s/2004/12/27/1103996496488.html">10000 dead</a> in a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/12/27/asia.quake/index.html">massive natural disaster</a>.  No point repeating the news.  But, I want to do my part to make people aware that they <b>can</b> help.  Many major international aid agencies have  set up donation schemes online, so don't just sit there - click on over to one (or more!) of these:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.redcross.org.au/Donations/onlineDonations.asp">The Australian Red Cross</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.careaustralia.org.au/show_mediarelease.asp?id=86">CARE Australia</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.oxfam.org.au/world/emergencies/asia_tsunami.html">Oxfam Australia</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It's like they're always trying to tell us - you <b>can</b> make a difference.</p>{% endmark %}
