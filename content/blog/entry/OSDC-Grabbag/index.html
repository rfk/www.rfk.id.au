{% mark excerpt %}<p>Last week I had a lot of fun attending the <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">Open Source Developers' Conference</a> at the Monash Caulfield campus.  Sadly I didn't have my blog running in time for it, so I've put together this quick grab-bag of thoughts and links from the conference, if you're interested.</p>
<ul>
<li>Photos are available on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/osdc2005/">Flickr</a>.</li>
<li>Met the Python release manager, a manic character in colourful pants named <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/anthonybaxter/">Anthony Baxter</a>.</li>
<li>Took part in my first ever <a href="http://www.keysigning.org/">GPG Keysigning</a>.</li>
<li>Treated to a stirring rendition of <a href="http://pugscode.org/talks/euroscon05/mariner.xul">Larry was a mariner</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Tang">Audrey Tang</a>, the most instantly fascinating person I've ever encountered.</li>
<li>An inspiring keynote from Jeff and Pia Waugh (a.k.a the "Tools for Freedom") on free software and how what we do fits into the infamous "Big Picture".</li>
<li>The largest collection of geek and hacker shirts I've ever seen in one place.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, a very enjoyable and informative conference - mostly technical content, but that's to be expected when you get a bunch of geeks together.  Baring exceptional circumstances, I'll definitely be going back next year...who knows, maybe I'll even be convinced to help out on the committee!</p>
<p>Who am I kidding?  We all know what I'm like with committees.  There wouldn't be any convincing necessary.</p>{% endmark %}
