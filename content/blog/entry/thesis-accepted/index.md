{% mark excerpt %}<p>I've been sitting on this news for a few weeks now, while I got all the final preparations taken care of.  I sent it off to the binders yesterday so I guess I can come clean: my PhD thesis has been accepted, and I'll soon be officially known as "Dr Kelly".  Has a nice ring to it, don't you think? :-)</p>

<p>A special thanks to <a href="http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/~adrian/">Adrian</a> for being a great supervisor over the past four years, it's been a very challenging and rewarding experience and I enjoyed the process immensely.  I've updated the page on <a href="/research/">my research</a> with a PDF version of <a href="/research/thesis/rfk-thesis.pdf">Asynchronous Multi-Agent Reasoning in the Situation Calculus</a>.  Hopefully I've found and updated all the other sections that said "my thesis is currently under examination" &ndash; please let me know if you spot any more.</p>{% endmark %}
