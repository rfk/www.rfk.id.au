I've been sitting on this news for a few weeks now, while I got all the final preparations taken care of.  I sent it off to the binders yesterday so I guess I can come clean: my PhD thesis has been accepted, and I'll soon be officially known as "Dr Kelly".  Has a nice ring to it, don't you think? :-)

A special thanks to [Adrian](http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/~adrian/) for being a great supervisor over the past four years, it's been a very challenging and rewarding experience and I enjoyed the process immensely.  I've updated the page on [my research](/research/) with a PDF version of [Asynchronous Multi-Agent Reasoning in the Situation Calculus](/research/thesis/rfk-thesis.pdf).  Hopefully I've found and updated all the other sections that said "my thesis is currently under examination" â€“ please let me know if you spot any more.<!-- more -->
