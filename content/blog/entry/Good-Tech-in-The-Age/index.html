{% mark excerpt %}<p>One of the long-time items in my RSS list is the technology news feed from The Age (http://feeds.theage.com.au/rssheadlines/technology.rss).  I like to keep abreast of what 'normal people' might be learning about technology.  Usually I cant bear to skim more than the first few lines of the articles, but lately they've been running some interesting (and, depending on your software politics, very promising!) articles.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was a surprisingly long article about <a href="http://theage.com.au/articles/2005/04/25/1114281483571.html">Apple's Tiger trouncing Microsoft's Longhorn</a> by actually bringing promised technology to the market.  Today, they're re-printing an opinion piece by Richard Stallman about the <a href="http://theage.com.au/articles/2005/04/27/1114462074994.html">Linux/BitKeeper fiasco</a>.</p>
<p>Does this indicate a shift in what are consided "mainstream" technology issues.  Or have I just never noticed issues like these leaking out of sites such as Slashdot?  Anyway, I for one am glad to see them turn up somewhere non-geek-affiliated and can only hope it's part of a growing trend.</p>{% endmark %}
