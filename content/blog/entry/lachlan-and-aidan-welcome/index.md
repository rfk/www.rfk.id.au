{% mark excerpt %}<p>My twin sons were born yesterday, 23 June 2009.  A warm welcome to the world to Lachlan Francis and Aidan James Kelly.  Photos <i>maybe</i> coming eventually, but it'll take some negotiating &ndash; Lozz has plenty of reservations about putting family photos on the Internet.</p>

<p>I'm not the sort to believe much in fate, but I'm delighted to note a couple of special coincidences with this date.  First, it's the birthday of one of my personal heroes: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a>, the father of modern computer science.  Second, it's the twentieth anniversary of <a href="http://www.rogerclarke.com/II/Anniv.html">Australia's connection to the Internet</a>, which took place right here in Melbourne.  Portentous of great things to come? We shall see...but delightful nonetheless!</p>{% endmark %}
