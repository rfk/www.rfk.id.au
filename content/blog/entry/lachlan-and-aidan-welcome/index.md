My twin sons were born yesterday, 23 June 2009.  A warm welcome to the world to Lachlan Francis and Aidan James Kelly.  Photos *maybe* coming eventually, but it'll take some negotiating â€“ Lozz has plenty of reservations about putting family photos on the Internet.

I'm not the sort to believe much in fate, but I'm delighted to note a couple of special coincidences with this date.  First, it's the birthday of one of my personal heroes: [Alan Turing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing), the father of modern computer science.  Second, it's the twentieth anniversary of [Australia's connection to the Internet](http://www.rogerclarke.com/II/Anniv.html), which took place right here in Melbourne.  Portentous of great things to come? We shall see...but delightful nonetheless!<!-- more -->
