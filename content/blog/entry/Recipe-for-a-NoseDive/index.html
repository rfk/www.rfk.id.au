<li>Attempt to develop software against an <a href="http://www.3ds.com/products-solutions/brands/CATIA/">application</a> with a half-baked, flaky automation interface containing methods which may or may not actually do something</li>
<li>Calling bindings through an <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/com/default.mspx">automation platform</a> that seems to operate solely by black-magic voodoo</li>
<li>Using a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/">hand-holding development environment</a> to incorporate "click here to insert magic" functionality that glues it together with your code</li>
<li>Prepare perfectly working software demo for important client</li>
<li>Store in a cool place to set for 1 hour</li>
<li>Discover that the application bindings have mysteriously been deregistered from the operating system and your demo will not even run in front of said client</li>
</ol>
<p>OK, so I'm probably being a little harsh.  But as you might have guessed, I've not been having much luck with the latest COM-based application we're developing at work.  No specifics folks as it's a commercial project, but can someone please explain why the COM bindings I need would be in place and working at 12:00 and completely missing at 1:00?</p>
<p><br />After such a delightful run developing in my <a href="http://www.python.org/">favorite language</a>, this new platform smacks of too many lofty promises of point-and-click-and-it-will-work and too much black magic.  And when it breaks, only voodoo-programming seems to fix it.</p>{% endmark %}
<p><br/>So maybe I'm just grumpy and frustrated being in a platform I don't fully understand.  But a complete failure of a software demo was not what I was hoping for on my second-last day of work...</p>
