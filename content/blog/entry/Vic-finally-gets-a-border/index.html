{% mark excerpt %}<p>Bizarre. According to the age, the border between Victoria and New South Wales was <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/02/16/1140052212765.html?from=rss">officially declared on 16th Feb 2006</a>.  That's right, yesterday.</p>
<p>It seems there was an age-old disagreement about precisely where the border should go.  However, probably due to the fact that it's been clearly marked on every map of Australia that anyone has ever seen, we just plum forgot about it for the last 130 years.</p>
<p>Whoopsy-daisy.</p>{% endmark %}
