{% mark excerpt %}<p>I just completed my first ever <a
href="http://cgi.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;rd=1&amp;item=6393566805&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MESO:IT">sale on eBay</a>.  Even better, it was the sale of my old mobile and was more than enough to recover the purchase of my new mobile.  Might seem like a trade-down, but the T68i will actually talk with my linux machine, something the old phone (a Motorola T720) would never do.  So, it's a win all round.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I am now looking at everything in my room and wondering what I'd be able to get for it.  I've got a lot of pieces from my deceased laptop which should still be in good working order.  And do I really need all these clothes...?</p>{% endmark %}
