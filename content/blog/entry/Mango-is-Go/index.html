{% mark excerpt %}<p>For anyone wondering why I've been mysteriously out of contact for the last few weeks, my desktop machine Mango was put out of commission by what looks to have been a power supply problem.  He's finally back on his feet after the power supply came back from warranty and the fried motherboard was replaced.  Here's hoping that my <a href="http://www.rfk.id.au/blog//6">run of bad luck</a> doesn't continue much longer...</p>
<p>I'd like to put in my own personal plug for the guys over at <a href="http://www.cpl.net.au/">Computers and Parts Land</a> who've been amazingly helpful throughout the whole ordeal.  Warranty service went off without a hitch, and when it was obvious that something else was broken they were happy to help diagnose it for a modest fee (I would have done it myself if I'd had a spare Athlon64 CPU and motherboard to test with, but sadly this isn't the case).</p>

<p>So hopefully everything goes back to normal now.  I can regain my Internet addiction just in time for the exam period.</p>{% endmark %}
