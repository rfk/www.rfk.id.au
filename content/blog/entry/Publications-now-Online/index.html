{% mark excerpt %}<p>I've updated the page describing <a href="http://www.rfk.id.au/research/">my research</a> with copies of the three publications I have authored so far: <a href="http://www.rfk.id.au/research/papers/rfkelly_iat2006.pdf">Towards High-Level Programming for Distributed Problem Solving</a>, <a href="http://www.rfk.id.au/research/papers/rfkelly_ijcai2007.pdf">Property Persistence in the Situation Calculus</a>, and <a href="http://www.rfk.id.au/research/papers/rfkelly_aamas2007.pdf">Knowledge and Observations in the Situation Calculus</a>.  The first in particular is a good overview of where my research is headed, while the other two are more specific technical papers.  Enjoy!</p>{% endmark %}
