{% mark excerpt %}<p>Sometimes burrowing through your site statistics is just a little too disturbing.  One particular phrase that turned up in my list of "top ten search terms" took me a little by surprise.  The effect is best demonstrated by the following procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://www.google.com.au/">http://www.google.com.au/</a></li>
<li>Select the "pages from Australia" button</li>
<li>Enter the query "her breasts sagged", including the quotes</li>
<li>Observe that the top-rated result points to the RFK.id.au domain.</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps the madness will stop when I work out how to seperate Sazz's site statistics from my own :-)</p>{% endmark %}
