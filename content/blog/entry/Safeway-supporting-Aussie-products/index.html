{% mark excerpt %}<p>According to the Ausbuy website, <a href="http://www.ausbuy.com.au/pages/default.cfm?page_id=13896#184757">Woolworths will be promoting Australian-owned products</a> in the week leading up to ANZAC day.  Of course, we southerners should replace "Woolworths" with "Safeway" as always.  So I'd encourage everyone to make the effort to buy some Aussie goods at Safeway during that week, to let them know that we care.</p>

<p>Assuming that you do in fact care...which you should!</p>{% endmark %}
