{% mark excerpt %}<p>According to a <a href="http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eoppc/bul/bulc/bulletinc.dat">bulletin</a> from the <a href="http://hpiers.obspm.fr/">International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service</a>, we are due for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second">Leap Second</a> at the end of the year.  This will help keep our atomic-clock-driven Coordinated Universal Time in line with "solar time".  Just like there aren't <b>exactly</b> 365 days in a solar year, there aren't <b>exactly</b> 86400 seconds in a solar day.  Unfortunately we cant predict when leap seconds will be needed due to the irregularity of the Earth's rotation, and must rely instead on emergency leap-second bulletins from the good folks mentioned above.</p>
<p>The extra second will be added to the UTC time signal at the end of December 31st, so it will go 23:59:59, 23:59:60, 00:00:00.  Hence, those in Greenwich will have an extra second to count down as they ring in the new year.  For we Melbournians on Australian Eastern Daylight Time (UTC+11, including the daylight savings hour), we should put our clocks back 1 second at 11:00:00 on January 1, 2006.  Failure to do so will result in chaos of millenium-bug proportions!</p>{% endmark %}
