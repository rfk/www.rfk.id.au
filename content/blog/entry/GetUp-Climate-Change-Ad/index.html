{% mark excerpt %}<p>For those of you not watching the grand final (or at least having it on in the background while they surf the net), here's a very timely parody ad that was aired by <a href="https://www.getup.org.au/">GetUp!</a> in this prime timeslot: <a href="https://www.getup.org.au/campaign/ClimateCleverer">https://www.getup.org.au/campaign/ClimateCleverer</a></p>
