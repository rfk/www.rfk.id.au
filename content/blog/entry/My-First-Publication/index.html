{% mark excerpt %}<p>I received some very exciting news this week: one of my research papers was accepted for publication at the <a href="http://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~wii06/iat/">2006 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology</a>.  As first publications go, that ain't a bad place to start!</p>
<p>It also means I'll be getting an at-least-partially-funded trip to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>I can't post the paper online just yet, since I am required to transfer copyright to the IEEE for publication, but if anyone is interested (or, better yet, feels like helping out with a final proof-read) then please drop me a line and I'll forward you a copy.  Familiarity with first-order logic and the situation calculus a plus ;-)</p>{% endmark %}
