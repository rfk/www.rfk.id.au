<p>Well that didn't take long.  The first part of my <a href="/blog/entry/dont-wanna-sysadmin-no-more/">migration from a VPS to managed services</a> is complete.  You might also notice that the website has had a facelift in the process.</p>

<p>While I've been trialling both <a href="http://www.dotcloud.com/">dotcloud</a> and <a href="http://www.ep.io/">ep.io</a> for hosting some more complex python webapps, for this simple site I decided it's just not worth the overhead and expense.  Instead I've gone with hosting static HTML on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, using a static site generator called <a href="http://hyde.github.com/">Hyde</a> to manage the blog.  So far, so good.</p>

<p>Do let me know if you find anything broken...</p>
