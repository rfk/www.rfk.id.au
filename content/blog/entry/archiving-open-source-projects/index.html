{% mark excerpt %}<p>It's well past time that I admitted something to myself: I am no longer actively maintaining any of my personal open-source projects.</p>

<p>Thankfully, this is not another story of open-source burnout.
I'm pretty good with boundaries,
I continue to love open-source and the communities that grow around it,
and am incredibly grateful that my <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">day job</a>
allows me to engage with them on a regular basis.
It's just that 30-something-year-old me has different priorities than 20-something-year-old me,
such as a full-time job that's a wonderful mix of engaging and exhausting,
a partner who works full-time as well,
and two kids who aren't yet old enough to be "too cool" to spend time with me.</p>

<p>As I was staring at my inbox this morning,
noticing that it was full of github issue reports
and thinking "I should really make time to respond to those"
and then feeling ashamed that some are now several months old,
I came to a surprising realisation &ndash;
it's not that I can't make time to maintain those projects these days,
it's that I <i>no longer want to</i>.
I'm not "busy with family stuff" like I've been in the habit of telling myself,
and I won't "get to that sometime soon".
I'm getting my software fix on the job and I'm spending my personal time on other things,
and I'm OK with that.</p>

<p>Of course, that doesn't stop me from feeling bad about leaving people hanging :-(</p>

<p>I'm reminded of <a href="http://glasnt.com/">Katie's</a> talk-within-a-talk from PyCon AU entitled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prFaJugC95Y">How to handle abandoned projects, Take Two</a> (which you should watch, by the way, for both the talk and the meta-talk) and of her advice to "abandon responsibly".  It's hard to admit that I'm at that point, especially for things I've worked on for years (like <a href="https://github.com/rfk/pyenchant/">PyEnchant</a>) or for things that really got folks excited (like <a href="https://github.com/pypyjs/pypyjs/">PyPy.js</a>).  But it's the right thing.</p>

<p>So here's what I'm going to be doing over the coming days:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updating a bunch of READMEs to mark projects as <a href="http://unmaintained.tech/">unmaintained</a> and to link to this post.</li>
<li>Closing a bunch of issues with an appology and a link to this post.</li>
<li>Archiving repos that I know I'm never going to personally revisit.</li>
<li>Disabling issues on a handful of repos that I might poke at on occasion for my own personal use.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you landed on this page by following a link from one of those repos, well um...hi!
Feel free to shoot me an email if you want to chat about the code or the project
(or anything really!) but I'll appologise in advance if it takes me a while to respond.</p>
