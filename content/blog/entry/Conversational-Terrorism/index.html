{% mark excerpt %}<p>I stumbled across this while doing my daily rounds of the Internet: <a href="http://www.vandruff.com/art_converse.html">Conversational Terrorism</a>.  It's a short exposition on some of the (ever more common) techniques people use to avoid intelligent debate in favour of "winning" an argument.</p>
<p>Highlights for me include "Wishful Thinking" and "I'm not saying this".  I cringe every time I hear someone say things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I'm not a racist, but..."</li>
<li>"Yes, but you're a [white male, feminist, capatilist pig, hippy]"</li>
</ul>
<p>The sad part is that I know I'm also guilty of using these techniques.  We seem more interested in winning an argument than in discovering truth, or seeing a different point of view.  It's encouraging to be able to see these non-arguments in daylight, think about how we use them, and then try to stop.</p>
<p>Just remember, every time you use one of these techniques, you're denying
yourself the opportunity for at least one of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning something new</li>
<li>Teaching something new</li>
</ul>
<p>I like to think that I would prefer to grow than win.  Of course, it's nice when you can do both at the same time :-)</p>{% endmark %}
