{% mark excerpt %}<p>Now look, we all know that my hatred of <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/">Flash</a> burns with the fire of a thousand suns.  But sometimes, just sometimes, a flash app will come along that makes me forget all about it for the briefest while. <a href="http://www.i-am-bored.com/bored_link.cfm?link_id=9316">Sing with Homer</a> is by far the best yet.</p>
<p><br />I can recommend "Mexican hat song" and "Hunger pain song" as two of my
personal favourites.</p>{% endmark %}
