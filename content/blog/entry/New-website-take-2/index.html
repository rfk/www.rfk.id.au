{% mark excerpt %}<p>After a lot of mucking around, my new website has been launched...again.  Looks about the same?  Maybe so, but the technology underlying it has been changed quite a bit.  The most immediate change is that I've <i>finally</i> implemented my blog.  For the rest of the technical details, read on...</p>
<p>The newest version of the site is implemented using the <a href="http://www.turbogears.org/">TurboGears</a> mega-framework.  When a bandwagon is a big as this, you know it's gotta be good!  Regardless of the type, I've been pretty impressed with TurboGears.</p>
<p>Of course, most of the magic is not due to TurboGears at all but to the underlying components - <a href="http://www.cherrypy.org/">CherryPy</a>, <a href="http://www.sqlobject.org/">SQLObject</a> and <a href="http://kid.lesscode.org/">Kid</a>.  I've found each of these to be a little miracle in code and it's made putting the site together a real joy (even moreso than usual!)</p>
<p>It sounds like the TurboGears crew have got a lot of goodies in the works for the upcoming 1.0 release.  I'll definitely be keeping an eye on this one.</p>{% endmark %}
