{% mark excerpt %}<p>My computer helpfully comes with the file <i>/usr/share/dict/propernames</i>, a list of proper names that can be used for spellchecking.  Consider my surprise at the following interaction:</p>
<pre>
rfk@mango ~ $
rfk@mango ~ $ wc -l /usr/share/dict/propernames
1516 /usr/share/dict/propernames
rfk@mango ~ $ grep 'Ragnar' /usr/share/dict/propernames
Ragnar
rfk@mango ~ $ grep 'Rainer' /usr/share/dict/propernames
Rainer
rfk@mango ~ $ grep 'Reinhard' /usr/share/dict/propernames
Reinhard
rfk@mango ~ $ grep 'Rodent' /usr/share/dict/propernames
Rodent
rfk@mango ~ $ grep 'Ryan' /usr/share/dict/propernames
rfk@mango ~ $
</pre>
<p>One thousand, five hundred and sixteen names and "Ryan" still doesnt make the cut.  To whom should I submit this travesty of a bug??</p>
<p>Well, at least I can take solace in the relative availability of "Ryan" mugs and keyrings throughout Australia...</p>{% endmark %}
