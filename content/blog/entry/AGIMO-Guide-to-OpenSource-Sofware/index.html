{% mark excerpt %}<p>Ever head of the <a href="http://www.agimo.gov.au/">Australian Government Information Management Office</a>?  Me neither, until Slashdot revealed that they have just released the <a href="http://www.sourceit.gov.au/sourceit/oss">Guide to Open Source Software for Australian Government Agencies</a>.  I've had a quick read and it seems remarkably fair, balanced and comprehensive.  Nice work Australian Government, it's nice to know I dont have to be <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2005/05/03/1114886321689.html?from=rss">ashamed</a> all the time.</p>
<p>So does the government "get it" about open-source?.  Maybe <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/software/0,2000061733,39190311,00.htm">not  quite</a>.  But it's a whole lot better than the "open-source is communisum" rhetoric that I keep hearing come out of the US.</p>{% endmark %}
