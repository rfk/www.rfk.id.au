{% mark excerpt %}<p>The official program for <a href="">PyCon Australia 2012</a> hasn't been announced yet, but folks have been tweeting about their talks so I might as well jump on in.  I'll be presenting "The Lazy Dev's Guide to Testing Your Web API" on the weekend of August 18/19 in the beautiful city of Hobart.  Here's the abstract to whet your appetite:</p>

<blockquote><p>Do you enjoy writing test cases for your web application?  If so then this may not be the talk for you.  I'm going to show you how to make a single test suite perform triple testing duty, so you can get on with writing the fun stuff.<br /><br />First, I'll show you how to use WebTest to construct a simple functional testsuite for your application.  By running in-process against a WSGI callable, the tests can be fast and light enough to form part of your regularly-executed suite.<br /><br />Second, we'll use WSGIProxy to turn this into a deployment/acceptance test script that you can point at a real live server to verify its behaviour.  Run this after every deployment to make sure you haven't broken something in the wild.<br /><br />Finally, we'll connect the suite to FunkLoad and pummel the server with a distributed barrage of tests, to see how it copes under pressure.</p></blockquote>{% endmark %}

<p>The material is based on some of the techniques we use for testing the <a href="https://services.mozilla.com/">Firefox Sync</a> server code at <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>.
