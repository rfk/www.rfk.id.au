{% mark excerpt %}<p>I'm a few days late but wanted to help spread the word:  the <a href="http://www.pycon-au.org/2011/about/">PyCon Australia 2011</a> conference has been officially announced, and will be held on 20th and 21st of August at the <a href="http://www.smcfc.com.au/">Sydney Masonic Centre</a>.  The official call for papers should open soon.</p>

<p>Last year's conference was the first PyCon AU, and it was a huge success; this year's going to be even bigger and better!  If you're thinking about whether to attend, you might like to check out the list of <a href="http://pycon-au.org/2010/conference/proposals/accepted/">presentations from PyCon AU 2010</a> and maybe even the <a href="http://pyconau.blip.tv/">videos</a> (especially <a href="http://pyconau.blip.tv/file/3840197/">this one...</a>).</p>
