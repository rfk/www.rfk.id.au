{% mark excerpt %}<p>I've just put enough finishing touches on my latest python project to release it into the wild: <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/proxylet/">proxylet</a> is a lightweight reverse proxy for HTTP with nonblocking IO courtesy of <a href="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Eventlet">eventlet</a>.</p>
<p>What's so great about it?  It can do something no other reverse proxy currently does: proxy to a remote subversion server <i>at an arbitrary remote path</i>.  Read on for why this is so difficult...</p>
<p>Subversion, in its infinite wisdom, uses absolute URLs in the body of its HTTP requests and responses.  This means that if you want to have a proxy at http://www.example.com/svn send subversion traffic to http://svn.example.com/some/other/path, you need to rewrite the request and response bodies!  This is such a dangerous business that most people just shy away from it, and insist that the local and remote paths be identical (<a href="http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2004-08/0746.shtml">example</a>).</p>
<p>Not me!  Proxylet contains enough reverse-engineered details of the subversion HTTP protocol (no, it's not just vanilla WebDAV) to achieve this in a safe, responsible manner.</p>
<p>Of course, proxylet can do more general reverse proxy work as well, but I haven't really pushed it in that direction yet.  Python hackers looking for a flexible, lightweight reverse proxy solution should find proxylet a good starting point.</p>{% endmark %}
