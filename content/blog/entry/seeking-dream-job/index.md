I need something new in my career.

Don't get me wrong.  I love what I do and I've no intention of abandoning the tech
scene to, say, [start an emu farm](http://www.snpp.com/episodes/5F20).
But the current combination of work, family and life in general is starting to wear us
all down.  It's time for a change.

And frankly, if you're going to make a change, you might as well make it the absolute
best one you can.  So for the duration of this post I'm going to try something rather
difficult – I'm going to switch off my usual unassuming, undemanding nature and
give myself permission to be greedy.  What's my dream job?  My serious, no-holds-barred,
anything-is-possible dream job.  Hopefully I don't come off sounding like an arrogant
jerk.

Because I need to know: does it exist, and do I have what it takes to land it?

### The Dream

I want to be **challenged**.  I want to hack with world-class developers and grow
to be one myself.  I want the opportunity to learn and to teach every day.  I want to
be part of a team that **loves their code** and **loves their job**.

I don't want to be tied to a big-city office.  I want to raise my kids in a nice town
in rural Victoria.  I want take a working road trip up the coast to see my family and
friends in Queensland.  I want to take my wife to see [Ningaloo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningaloo_Reef) and [Kakadu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakadu_National_Park).  Basically, I want a job that I can **take with me** and do from anywhere.
Or at least anywhere with broadband.

I want to write **code that matters**.

I want a company that respects **open source**.  That encourages community involvement
and knows how to leverage the global software pool to everyone's mutual benefit.  That has
sensible IP policies about projects I work on in my own time.

I want **flexibility**.  I want to start late if we've had a rough night with a
child.  I want to start early if there's an idea I can't get out of my head.  Once in a
while I want to cram the work week into four days and spend a long weekend doing something
with the family.  And I want confidence that not only will I get the job done, but
I'll get it done *well*.

I want a company that would accept a [github page](http://github.com/rfk/)
as a resume and a [blog post](./) as a cover letter.

And as long as my family isn't left wanting, I can give my kids the opportunities
they deserve, and I don't feel under-appreciated, then all of these things are more
important to me than the figure on the paycheck.

### The Pitch

That sounds like a tall order.  But surely there must be a job out there that
fits my version of the dream, and I believe that I'd be perfect for it.  Here's why.

I'm a **smart** guy.  Ugh.  I hate putting it so bluntly, especially since "smart"
counts for so little on its own.  But this is a pitch after all, and I do have the
[creds](/about/cv.html#education) to back it up.

I'm **determined**.  I believe that almost any problem can be solved with the right
combination of creativity and brute force.  Here's just one example:  when I was unhappy
that a frozen python application was far too large, I spent two days writing a tool to 
[hack dead code from the GUI library](/blog/entry/hatchet-hack-frozen-pyside-apps/)
and cut over 40MB off the final size of the application.

I'm **passionate**.  About good code, good coding, and good developers.  I am always
striving to improve my [
development practices](http://www.rfk.id.au/blog/entry/testing-better-coverage-tox/).  I love to [share my code](https://github.com/rfk)
and be part of a thriving developer community.

I'm **omnivorous**.  Lately I have been specialising in Python and JavaScript,
but I'm just as at home flipping bits in C, pruning search trees in Prolog,
or doing [
distributed problem solving](http://www.rfk.id.au/blog/entry/forking-ec2-instances-mozart-oz/) with Mozart/Oz.  On my most recent freelance gig,
I found good cause to work some [
classical AI techniques](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-first_search) into an otherwise standard Django-based website](None).

I'm **articulate**.  I like to write and I love to talk.  I'm as comfortable
[demonstrating a new API](http://blip.tv/pycon-australia/esky-keep-your-frozen-apps-fresh-3859194) as I am [discussing
social issues in engineering](http://www.rfk.id.au/ramblings/CAE_be_free.html).  Lately I've been something of a fixture at the
[Melbourne Python Users Group](http://wiki.python.org/moin/MelbournePUG) and
I love the feeling of connecting and sharing with a group of like-minded developers.

Finally, I'm **pragmatic**.  I don't expect this dream job to fall into my lap.  But
by putting this up here, I do hope to hear about some interesting opportunities that I can
set myself toward pursuing.

Even better, are you a company looking to hire someone like me?  I've got
[ten years experience](/about/cv.html) from academia to
engineering to the web; a [big stack of code](http://github.com/rfk/) that I'm
proud to have written; and a burning desire to combine an awesome career in software with
a happy family and a balanced life. Please, [let's talk](/about/).
