{% mark excerpt %}<p>Just a quite note to mark an updated release of <a href="http://www.rfk.id.au/software/projects/filelike/">filelike</a>.  Version <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/filelike/0.3.2">0.3.2</a> offers a lot of small robustness fixes and many new unit tests, much improved support for files opened in append mode, and a new filelike wrapper "FlushableBuffer" for buffering streaming reads/writes so they can be treated like a random-access file.</p>

<p>This library forms part of the backbone of a new project I'm working on, so expect to see more frequent releases over the next few months.</p>{% endmark %}
