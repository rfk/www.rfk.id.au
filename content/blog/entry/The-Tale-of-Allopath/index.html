{% mark excerpt %}<p>A well-done little piece of satire today entitled <a href="http://melbourne.indymedia.org/news/2005/06/92909.php">Allopath - Medicine &amp; Economic Efficiency</a>, courtesy of Melbourne Indymedia.  While it's clearly aimed square at the Medical Industry, I found it an interesting perspective on many aspects of the world today.</p>{% endmark %}
