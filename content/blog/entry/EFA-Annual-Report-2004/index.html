{% mark excerpt %}<p><a href="http://www.efa.org.au">Electronic Frontiers Australia</a> have released their <a href="http://www.efa.org.au/News/report.board04.html">Annual Board Report</a> for 2004.  It provides a pretty decent summary of the important issues and events for online privacy and intellectual property in Australia this year.</p>
<p><br />As you might know, I'm a  <a href="http://www.rfk.id.au/ramblings/support/efa.html">yearly member</a> of the EFA.  If these issues are important to you, please consider <a href="http://www.efa.org.au/JoinEFA/">joining up</a> to make sure all the arguments are heard.</p>{% endmark %}
