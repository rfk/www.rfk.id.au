{% mark excerpt %}<p>After a solid few days of emerging, I am now posting this from the newest addition to my little technology menagerie: Grapefruit.  He's a Dell Latitude D500, courtesy of <a href="http://jre.thinkshiny.com/">Josh</a>.  Pentium-M 1300MHz, 512MB, 40GB, none stoo shabby :-).</p>
<p>Still a lot of things to work out, wifi and software suspend being to big two.   I get the feeling this is going to test Linux's laptop capabilities, but I'm confident it'll come out on top...</p>
<p>For the curious, the full team is now as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Mango:</b>  AMD64 running Gentoo on my desktop</li>
<li><b>Pawpaw:</b> The same AMD64, but running Windows (pawpaw being my least favourite fruit...)</li>
<li><b>Banana:</b> Celeron 500Mz running gentoo and serving this webste</li>
<li><b>Passionfruit:</b> Sony Ericsson T68i</li>
<li>An as-yet-not-quite-functional-and-thus-unnamed Sharp Zaurus 5500</li>
<li>And now, of course <b>Grapefruit</b></li></ul>{% endmark %}
