{% mark excerpt %}<p>From the Sydney Morning Herald, via Reddit: a group of US businesses are preparing <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2006/04/16/1145126007268.html">a guide for Americans travelling overseas</a> to combat the image of the &quot;Ugly American&quot;.  The sample tips provided in the story are worth a look, as most of them are actually pretty OK - not the kind of insensitive tripe I was expecting.  Of course, it's sad to have to say most of them at all. My personal favourite is:</p>
<p>&quot;<b>Save the lectures for your kids</b>. Whatever your subject of discussion, let it be a discussion not a lecture. Justified or not, the US is seen as imposing its will on the world.&quot;</p>
<p>While I'm sure the last sentence is supposed to mean "whether that viewpoint is justified or not", the first time I read it it ended up as "whether the US is justified or not".  But in any case, it's damn good advice.</p>{% endmark %}
