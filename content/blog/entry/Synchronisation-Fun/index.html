{% mark excerpt %}<p>After almost a year and a half of wishing and sporadic bursts of actually trying, I've finally put together all the ingredients for the perfect synchronisation setup:</p>

<li>Cheap-as-chips <a href="http://search.ebay.com.au/bluetooth_Networking-IT-Telecoms">USB Bluetooth Dongle</a></li>
<li>Trusty old <a href="http://www.sharp.net.au/catalogue/productinfo.asp?model=SL5500">Sharp Zaurus SL5500</a> PDA</li>
<li>An awesome synchronisation toolkit called <a href="http://www.multisync.org/">MultiSync</a></li>
</ul>
<p>My contacts, calendar and TODO list are now automatically kept in sync between my computer, PDA, phone, and a CVS backup on my server.  There wasnt even that much tweaking involved, just toying with the bits and pieces to make sure I understand them.  Anyone looking for a good synchronisation setup under Linux, I can recommend any of these compenents.</p>
<p><br />The best part?  I may not have had a clue who was calling me for the past year, but I didnt have to transfer all my contacts into my mobile by hand!</p>{% endmark %}
