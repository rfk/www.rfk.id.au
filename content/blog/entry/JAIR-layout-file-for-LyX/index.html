{% mark excerpt %}<p>I have created a simple layout file for <a href="http://www.lyx.org/">LyX</a> to edit articles for the <a href="http://www.jair.org/">Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research</a>.  Link: <a href="/scratch/jair.layout">jair.layout</a></p>
<p>Basically, it provides some theorem-numbered environments (Theorem, Lemma, Definition, etc) and enables advanced citation styles in theapa format.  Enjoy!</p>{% endmark %}
