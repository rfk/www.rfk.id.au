{% mark excerpt %}<p>The ex-collegians reading this will probably start salivating at the very mention of the name: "Intersection Pizza".  Yes, for my four long years at college it was synonymous with late-night pizza cravings, great deals and all-round popular-pizza-place-ness. Perhaps everything looks better through the innocent eyes of a collegian...</p>
<p>Sazz and I have had a long-standing tradition of Thursday night pizza and TV.  Intersection happen to have a two-for-twenty pizza deal and deliver for free.  Combined with all those fond memories, it seemed like a match made in heaven.  Unfortunately things werent quite the way we remembered them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Almost everyone who answers the phone seems to have a hearing problem, so you never know if they've got your address right</li>
<li>No-one seems capable of understanding the concept of "Diet Coke".  Thank god we're not diabetic</li>
<li>Burnt-cheese seems to be their favourite flavour</li>
<li>The words "margherita" and "mushroom" are indistinguishable</li>
</ul>
<p>After weeks and weeks of this, Sazz was finally fed-up enough to tell the guy on the phone that we're unhappy and will be taking our business elsewhere.  The response?  A hearty scoff.</p>
<p>So we are officially boycotting Intersection Pizza, starting now.  Why am I blogging this?  Well, what's the point of a boycott if no-one knows about it?  But more importantly, we are now in the market for a pizza restaurant that delivers to the West Brunswick area.  Any suggestions?</p>{% endmark %}
