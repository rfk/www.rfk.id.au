{% mark excerpt %}<p>I think people have generally cottoned on that it's a bad idea to cite <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> when trying to establish something as fact.  But let this gem from <a href="http://www.britannica.com/">Britannica Online</a> serve as a reminder that the problem goes well beyond the fact-police's favourite whipping boy:</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9071420/tautology">definition of &quot;tautology&quot;</a>: 
<i>Thus, &quot;All men are rational&quot; is held to assert with regard to anything whatsoever that either it is a man or it is not rational.</i></p>
<p>This is, of course, completely wrong.  The second statement is the converse of the first.  Let me make two quick points in Wikipedia's favour:</p>
<ul>
<li>If this was on Wikipedia, I could simply have <b>fixed</b> it instead of writing about it.</li>
<li>The Wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_%28logic%29">Logical Converse</a> has a nice long explanation of why this is an error.</li>
</ul>{% endmark %}
