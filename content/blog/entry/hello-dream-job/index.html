<p>It's been two months since I posted <a href="/blog/entry/seeking-dream-job/">Passionate Developer seeks Dream Job</a>, and I've been overwhelmed by the positive response it has generated - lots of well wishes, kind words, advice, and several really interesting opportunities.  Even better, I'm happy to announce that the story has a happy ending.</p>

<p>The short version is that I start with <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/">Mozilla</a> next week, working as a contractor with the Services team.  It's been quite a ride to get here, so read on if you're interested in the long-version debrief.</p>

{% endmark %}

<p>Perhaps the most surprising thing is that there are <i>lots</i> of opportunities out there that would tick many, if not most, of the boxes in <a href="/blog/entry/seeking-dream-job/#the-dream">my list</a>.  I've spoken to big open-source companies like <a href="http://www.canonical.com/about-canonical/careers">Mozilla</a> and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/careers.html">Canonical</a>, independent open-source vendors like <a href="http://flowplayer.org/">flowplayer</a> and <a href="http://www.nexb.com/corp/aboutus.html">nexB</a>, local companies like <a href="http://www.citrus.com.au/">Citrus</a> and <a href="http://www.kogan.com.au/">Kogan</a>, and of course my fair share of recruiters.</p>

<p>If you're a python developer with big dreams and a passion for open-source, do yourself a favour and check out some of the links above.  The opportunities are definitely out there.</p>

<p>Over the past few weeks I have had the privilege to interview with two of the world's leading open-source technology companies.  I spoke to nine great developers from around the world.</p>

So is Mozilla my dream job?  Let's take a look:

    I want to be challenged. I want to hack with world-class developers and grow to be one myself. I want the
    opportunity to learn and to teach every day. I want to be part of a team that loves their code and loves their
    job.

Yep.  "Super geniuses".  Love what they do.

	I want a job that I can take with me and do from anywhere. Or at least anywhere with broadband.

One in France, one in Toronto, a bunch throghout the US.

	I want to write code that matters.

Mozilla are helping to build the future of the internet.  I think that qualifies.

	I want a company that respects open source.

Everything they do is open.

	I want flexibility. I want to start late if we've had a rough night with a child. I want to start early if there's an idea I can't get out of my head. Once in a while I want to cram the work week into four days and spend a long weekend doing something with the family. And I want confidence that not only will I get the job done, but I'll get it done well.

Hire smart people, let them do their thing.

	I want a company that would accept a github page as a resume and a blog post as a cover letter.

	And as long as my family isn't left wanting, I can give my kids the opportunities they deserve, and I don't feel under-appreciated, then all of these things are more important to me than the figure on the paycheck.


I'm not naturally adventurous, took a lot of post that initial article.  But so glad I did.

Now I had a lot to prove, but I'm excited for the challenge.
