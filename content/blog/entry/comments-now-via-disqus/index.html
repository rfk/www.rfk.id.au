{% mark excerpt %}<p>After too many trips to the admin interface to delete spammy comments, I've finally given in and outsourced the comments on this blog.  They're now hosted by <a href="http://disqus.com/">disqus</a> and I'm <i>hoping</i> this will help keep the spam down.  Please <a href="http://www.rfk.id.au/about/">email</a> if you encounter any problems with the new interface</p>

<p>Why disqus over the alternatives such as <a href="http://intensedebate.com/">Intense Debate</a>?  No deep functional or philosophical reason &ndash; I just happen to know disqus is a python/django shop, so in some small way supporting them is like supporting the whole python community :-)</p>{% endmark %}
