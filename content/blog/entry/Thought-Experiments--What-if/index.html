{% mark excerpt %}BBC news has an interesting piece on some <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4954856.stm">thought experiments for ethical dilemmas</a>.  At first reading, they seem pretty contrived and often one answer will be &quot;just obvious&quot;. I encourage you to try them out, decide whether you would answer yes or no, then have a read about the implications of these choices in real-world situations.  Our ethical choices arent always so cut-and-dried - how would you resolve the difference between "The Runaway Trolley Car" and "The Fat Man and the Trolley Car" scenarios?{% endmark %}
