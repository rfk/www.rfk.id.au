{% mark excerpt %}<p>I'm moving the hastily hacked-together site news section of my <a href="http://www.rfk.id.au/">website</a> to my blog, both to get it into some sort of manageable system and to try my luck with <a href="http://www.coreblog.org">COREBlog</a>.  The rest of the blog is available at <a href="http://www.rfk.id.au/blog/">http://www.rfk.id.au/blog/</a>. The previous riveting site news postings will sadly be lost forever.</p>{% endmark %}
