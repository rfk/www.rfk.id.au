{% mark excerpt %}<p>I've just released the results of a solid day's hacking:
<a href="http://www.rfk.id.au/software/projects/pyenchant/">PyEnchant</a>.  It's a set of bindings and wrapper classes for the cross-platform spellchecking library <a href="http://www.abisource.com/enchant/">Enchant</a>.  If you're in the market for a simple but powerful spellchecking API, check it out.</p>
<p>All this was possible due to a great little tool called <a href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a>, the simplified wrapper and interface generator.  It's a nifty way to automatically produce scripting language bindings (to python, perl, tcl, scheme, you name it!) from C/C++ source files.  Which isn't to say that I didn't do any work to get PyEnchant up and running, but it sure made things a lot easier than they could have been!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it's not a pure-python application so you're going to need a C compiler to install it.  It also means there's no Windows version for download since I cant one on my Linux box.  But there's an ebuild of course :-)</p>{% endmark %}
