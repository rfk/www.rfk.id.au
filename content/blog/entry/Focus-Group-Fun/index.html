{% mark excerpt %}<p>I've just returned from participating in my first ever <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_group">focus group</a>, a "database user survey" conducted by <a href="http://www.philology.com.au/">Philology</a>.  It was, surprisingly, quite a fun and interesting experience, and I learned a lot about products that I've never had occasion (or, frankly, desire) to look into: seems like a good chunk of the world is terribly keen on Oracle and MS-SQL servers, for example.  A brief summary:</p>
<p><b>Pro: </b>Getting paid to spout off your opinions is just as much fun as it sounds - easiest money I've ever made short of finding it on the ground.<br />
<b>Con: </b>Zoning out and absently playing with my face, forgetting that the whole affair is being recorded by at least two cameras.<br />
<b>Pro: </b>Free food and drink!<br />
<b>Con: </b>Eating sounds a lot louder and your drinking face feels a lot stupider when you know it's all on tape.<br />
<b>Pro: </b>Geeks are very unlikely to talk over the top of one another, so we all got heard.<br />
<b>Con: </b>Discovered that the rest of the world is in love with C# and Java.<br />
<b>Pro: </b>Got to promote open-source database technologies.<br />
<b>Con: </b>Discovered that the only open-source database with significant mindshare is MySQL.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I think the study is coming to a close, otherwise I'd be recommending everyone have a go.  Cash, free food, and a captive audience - what more could you ask for on a Thursday afternoon?</p>{% endmark %}
