{% mark excerpt %}<p>After a long night and big morning, I've finally finished my poster for the CS department's poster day this Friday.  If anyone is interested in an overview of my research work (or an indication of the limits of my artistic ability) then this poster is probably a good start: 
<a href="http://www.rfk.id.au/research/poster2005.ps.gz">PostScript</a>, <a href="http://www.rfk.id.au/research/poster2005.pdf">PDF</a>.</p>
<p>Be aware that this is an A1 size poster - that's eight A4 sheets - so the files are pretty big.</p>{% endmark %}
