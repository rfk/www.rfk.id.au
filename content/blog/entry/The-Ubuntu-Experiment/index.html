{% mark excerpt %}<p>Last Monday afternoon I decided it was time to experience something new and different: a new Linux distribution.  Of course if you know anything about Linux you'll know that the hottest new distro on the web is <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu Linux</a>.  I spent a full two days with it on my laptop before going back to my old favourite, <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a>.</p>
<p>So, keep reading if you want to hear more about it.  For the free-time-challenged, here's the summary: I wouldnt hesitate to hand a Ubuntu CD to someone for their first Linux experience.</p>
<p>I jotted down a few notes during the experiment, which I'm sure can stand in for a mini-review:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beginning installation at 3:10pm by booting from the Ubuntu install CD</li>
<li>Simple text-based installer is remarkly clean and good-looking</li>
<li>Lack of unexplained jargon is quite remarkable all throughout the install</li>
<li>And yet, I dont feel limited by the clickable options, they have provided a very good interface to advanced install functionality if you want it</li>
<li>Prompted to create an ordinary user account but <b>not</b> to set a root password.  I find out later that the root user is disabled and administration is done using sudo, similar to the way OSX does things</li>
<li>After around 10 minutes, I've rebooted once and am waiting patiently while Ubuntu installs itself</li>
<li>At 3:36pm, I am presented with the login screen.  That makes it 26 minutes for a first-time install - not bad!</li>
<li>Integration of sudo for administrative tasks is seamless, using gtksu to prompt for your password where appropriate</li>
<li>All the "standard" apps are available by default, plus some very nice little administrative tools such as network settings.  I'd like to see a Linux newbie try these out...</li>
<li>After getting a few things I needed the package manager, the install was only 1.6G</li>
<li>Lots of little things working out of the box, that are a real pain to muck around with usually:
  <ul>
  <li>Volume up/down function keys</li>
  <li>Blanking when the laptop lid closes (although I dont think it as a full suspend, that's coming in the next version)</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>The boot process is at least twice as fast as Gentoo.  I think this has a lot to do with them firing up the login manager as soon as humanly possible, the same way that XP does things</li>
<li>I got really frustrated really quickly with having to install gcc, gtk-dev, enchant-dev, python-dev, and the header files for all the other stuff I need.  Spoilt by Gentoo I guess, but it makes sense for 'ordinary' users</li>
<li>Most software is a few minor versions behind that available in Gentoo's portage</li>
</ul>
<p>All around a very positive experience.  I'd say "keep an eye on this one" if you're into new distros.  So why did I switch back?  The bleeding edge.  Having two out of three machines running Gentoo and one running a few versions behind was just a little too frustrating.  I'm sure if everything was running Ubuntu I'd have been very happy with it.</p>{% endmark %}
