{% mark excerpt %}<p>First, the good news: I traded in my Queensland license for a shiny new Victorian driver's license.  Given that I've been living here for over five years now, it's probably about time.  It also means I'm one step shy of being a full-blown Victorian - I am yet to buy any AFL merchandise.</p>
<p><br />Unfortunately, my new home state has seen fit to demote me - this little change has also meant that I am <b>back on my P's</b> until the end of July.  Never mind the fact that I've been driving for the last six years.  Never mind that I've held my <b>Queensland Open License</b> for two and a half years now.  I am <b>sooo mad</b> at VicRoads at the moment...</p>
<p>You see, my just-turned-in Queensland license had the following information on it:</p>
<br />
<table cellpadding="2" border="1">
<tr><th>Type</th><th>Effective</th><th>Expiry Date</th></tr>
<tr><td>P</td><td>28-06-2002</td><td>28-06-2002</td></tr>
<tr><td>O</td><td>29-06-2002</td><td>28-06-2007</td></tr>
</table>
<br />
<p>To me, to Queensland Transport, and to anyone with half  brain, this indicates that I got rid of my P's on 28th of July 2002 and was issued a new license for my O's, the one that I showed up with to the VicRoads office.</p>
<p>To VicRoads, this indicates that I started my P's on the 28th of July 2002, graduated from them <b>on the same day</b> and moved on to my O's.  Therefore, I havent been driving for the three years necessary to qualify for a Victorian open license.  Never mind that the Queensland system is <b>exactly the freakin same</b> as the Victorian system and I must have held my Queenland P's for three years to get an open license.</p>{% endmark %}
<p><br /><b>Ooooh</b> I'm mad at VicRoads right now!</p>
