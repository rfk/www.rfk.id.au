{% mark excerpt %}<p>On Tuesday 23rd November 2004, I sat at a desk in the Royal Exhibition Building for what would be, catastrophes aside, the last time.  The subject?  Human Resource Management, the most boring and nonsensical subject I had encountered throughout five years of my degree.  The occasion?  That five year degree was finally over.  I don't think it's actually sunk in yet, but I wont have to sit another exam for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Of course, it's now the 27th and you might be wondering why I'm only just blogging this now. Well, Lauren and I have just returned from a vacation to the sunny Gold Coast, staying at the lovely <a href="http://www.conrad.com.au/jupiters/default.htm">Conrad Jupiters</a> hotel and casino.  Complementary buffet breakfast, flat-screen TV, DVD player, on-demand movies, in-room internet access and an amazing swimming pool helped make five years of years all seem worthwhile.  If anyone's planning a trip, I can highly recommend them - especially with a little help from the last-minute deals at <a href="http://www.travel.com.au/">Travel.com.au</a> to make it doable.</p>
<p><br />What's next?  Hopefully a postgraduate scholarship and a Masters in Computer Science, with an eye to rolling it into a PhD.  If it comes through, I'm sure you'll hear about it :-)</p>{% endmark %}
