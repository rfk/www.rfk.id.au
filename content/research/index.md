  <h1>Ryan's Research</h1>

  <p>What's the point of doing academic work if you're not sharing it with the 
world?  These pages contain the outcomes and results from my PhD research.</p>

  <h3>Thesis</h3>
  <p>My thesis is entitled "Asynchronous Multi-Agent Reasoning in the Situation Calculus" and was submitted in October 2008.  You can read all about it on the following page: <a href="./thesis/">Ryan's Thesis</a>.</p>

  <h3>Papers</h3>
<p>So far my research has resulted in five publications.  The copyright for 
each paper has been transferred to the respective publisher, but I've 
reproduced them here with permission:
