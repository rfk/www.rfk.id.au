<p>See my <a href="/blog/">blog</a> for up-to-the-minute ramblings.  Here are the latest headlines for your convenience:</p> 

<ul>
{% for res in resource.node.parent.walk_resources_sorted_by_time()[:5] %}
  <li><a href="{{ content_url(res.url) }}">{{ res.meta.title }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<p>The following pages contain a more detailed collection of my thoughts on any number of issues - basically,
anything I have had the time and the inclination to write about.  I have tried to enforce
a little structure but make no guarantees about how organised things are.</p>

<ul>
  <li>An overview of the <a href="./research/">research</a> I conducted for my doctoral thesis.</li>
  <li>An introduction to why I use <a href="./gpg/">Gnu Privacy Guard</a> for most of my electronic communications.</li>
  <li>A speech I gave in  September 2004 about the need for <a href="./CAE_be_free.html">Open Software in Computer-Aided Engineering</a>.</li>
</ul>
