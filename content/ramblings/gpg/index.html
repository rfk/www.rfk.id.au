  <h1>GNU Privacy Guard</h1>

  <p>If you have received email from me, chances are it was accompanied by an attachment
  named "signature.asc".  This attachment contains a digital signature created by the
  GNU Privacy Guard.</p>

  <p>The GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) is a software suite implementing public-key encryption
  and verification services.  The official <a href="http://www.gnupg.org">GPG Website</a> has
  an excellent introduction to what this means, along with a great deal of technical matter.
  I will try to give a brief overview here.</p>

  <p>If you are already familiar with GPG, please skip directly to the section containing
  <a href="#a_details">my GPG details</a>.</p>

  <h2>What does it do?</h2>

  GPG (and other software which operates in the same way) provides a means to perform the
  following basic functions:

  <ul>
    <li>Encrypt messages between two parties without the need to agree on external data
        such as a password.</li>
    <li>Verify that a message was sent by the person who claims to have sent it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How does it work?</h2>

  <p>In a public-key system such as that implemented by GPG, each person has a special file
  they keep on their computer known as their "private key".  This file is password-protected
  and should not be accessible to or known to anyone but the person who owns it.  Each
  private key has associated with it a "public key", which can be distributed to anyone with
  whom the key's owner wants to communicate.  In reality, the pair of keys are two very large
  numbers which are related in a special way.</p>

  <p>I will demonstrate the communication process
  using my friend <a href="http://www.josh.sg">Josh</a> as an example, as he uses
  similar software from time to time.</p>

  <h3>Encrypting a Message</h3>
  <p>To send an encrypted message (such as an email) to Josh, I need to obtain his public
  key.  I apply a transformation to the message which is based upon his public key, and send
  it out using normal email.  The transformation is constructed in such a way that it can
  only be reversed using Josh's private key.  Since he is the only person who has access to
  this key, he is the only person who will be able to read the message.</p>

  <h3>Verifying a Message</h3>
  <p>Alternately, suppose I am simply sending Josh a normal email.  How can he tell that it
  did in fact come from me?  Or that the message he receives is the same as the one I
  originally sent?  I use a mathematical calculation to produce what is known as a "digest"
  of the message - basically, a large number calculated based on the message contents.  I
  then use my private key to "sign" the digest, and send it along with the message.</p>

  <p>The signature is constructed in such a way that it is not possible to duplicate it
  without knowing my private key.  However, my public key can be used to verify that the
  signature was made by the corresponding private key.  To check that everything is OK with
  the message, Josh first used my public key to do precisely this and now knows that the
  message came from me.  The second step is to compute the digest of the message he received
  and compare it to the one I sent.  If the two differ, the message has somehow been changed
  in transit.</p>

  <h2>Why do I use it?</h2>

  <p>None of the email that I send is really worth bothering to encrypt.  However, in my
  ideal world signing a digital message would be as common as signing a physical message - it
  would be considered very bad form not to do so.  I am attempting to make this ideal into
  a reality.</p>

  <p>From a practical standpoint, my use of GPG allows you to have a greater degree of
  confidence in my communications with you.  I am often sending out instructions/advice for
  people to try on their computers, sometimes even sending out pieces of software.  By
  signing each email, the recipients can verify that that everything is legitimate and if
  something goes wrong can feel quite justified in blaming me.</p>

  <h2><a id="a_details">My GPG Details</a></h2>

  </ul>

  <p>The GPG handbook states that whenever you receive a new public key, you should take
  steps to verify its authenticity with the owner.  Do not underestimate the importance
  of this verification - the whole system of trust will break down if keys cannot be guaranteed
  to belong to the people that claim them. <b>Please</b> follow the recommendations - call me,
  or at the very least email me, and ask me to verify the authenticity of the key you have
  downloaded.  I will be very happy to oblige.</p>
