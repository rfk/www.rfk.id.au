## Ryan F. Kelly

I am a software engineer from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverloch,_Victoria">seaside town</a> on <a href="https://www.bunuronglc.org/">Bunurong Country</a> near Melbourne, Australia.
I currently spend my days hacking in Rust and Python as a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://harrison.ai/">harrison.ai</a>.

I'm fascinated by  the theory, the practice, and the craft of Software Engineering, and I occasionally try to write about it here.
