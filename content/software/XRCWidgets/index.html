<h2>XRCWidgets</h2>

<p><b>XRCWidgets</b> is a rapid GUI development framework for Python.
It utilises the excellent
<a href="http://www.wxpython.org">wxPython</a> toolkit and provides a number
of facilities to make creating and maintaining GUIs faster and easier.</p>

<p>Features include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GUI Description stored in an XML file, so it can be updated independently of the code</li>
  <li>Easy integration with GUI designers such as <a href="http://wxglade.sourceforge.net/">wxGlade</a></li>
  <li>Shortcuts for connecting common event handlers</li>
  <li>Automatic detection of GUI descriptions based on class name</li>
</ul>


<h3>Current Release</h3>

<p>The current release is <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/XRCWidgets/0.2.1">XRCWidgets-0.2.1</a>.  Development is still in the early
stages but it should be usable for small projects.  Most of the functionality
will be added only as I need it for other projects, but bug reports or enhancement
requests will certainly be appreciated.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/X/XRCWidgets/XRCWidgets-0.2.1.tar.gz">source-code</a>
      or the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/packages/any/X/XRCWidgets/XRCWidgets-0.2.1.win32.exe">Windows installer</a>.</li>
  <li>Find out more in the XRCWidgets manual: <a href="./rel_0_1_7/manual.ps">PostScript</a>,
      <a href="./rel_0_1_7/manual.pdf">PDF</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need a recent version of Python and wxPython installed.</p>

<h3>Licencing Details</h3>

<p>As of version 0.2.0, this code and associated documentation are released
under the terms of the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT licence</a>.  Previous versions were available under an LGPL variant called the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/wxwindows.php">wxWindows Licence</a>; the new license is strictly more permissive than the old.</p>

<p>It should also be mentioned that this code was inspired by skills I learned
during my summer work with <a href="http://www.vpac.org/">The Victorian Partnership
for Advanced Computing</a>.  While it shares no code with anything I developed there,
I would not be in a position to develop it without the opportunities for learning
that they provided me.</p>
