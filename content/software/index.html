<h1>Software</h1>

<p>I develop several open-source software projects &ndash; some because I use them in my work, and some just for fun.  You can get directly at most of my code through my <a href="http://github.com/rfk">github public page</a>.</p>

<h2>Libraries</h2>
<ul class="projects">
<li><a href="http://github.com/rfk/esky">Esky</a> is an auto-update framework for frozen Python applications.  It provides
a simple API through which apps can find, fetch and install updates, and a
bootstrapping mechanism that keeps the app safe in the face of failed or
partial updates.</li>
<li><a href="http://rfk.github.com/pyenchant/">PyEnchant</a> is a spellchecking module for Python.  It wraps the excellent <a href="http://www.abisource.com/projects/enchant/">Enchant</a> spellchecking library and provides a nice "Pythonic" object-oriented interface.</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyfilesystem/">FS</a> is a filesystem abstraction for Python, providing uniform access to ordinary filesystems, zipfiles, Amazon S3 and more; spearheaded by <a href="http://www.willmcgugan.com/">Will McGugan</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://rfk.github.com/filelike/">filelike</a> is a Python module for building and manipulating file-like objects.  It makes it easy to implement things such as transparent compression or encryption using simple wrapper classes.</li>
<li><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dexml/">dexml</a> is a simple Object-XML mapper for Python, loosely inspired by the Django Object-Relational mapper.</li>
<li><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/extprot/">extprot</a> is a compact, efficient, extensible binary protocol for messaging and data serialisation; this module is a Python implementation of a spec from <a href="http://eigenclass.org/R2/writings/extprot-extensible-protocols-intro">Mauricio Fern√°ndez</a></li>
<li><a href="http://rfk.github.com/XRCWidgets/">XRCWidgets</a> is a rapid GUI development module for Python. It uses the <a href="http://www.wxpython.org/">wxPython</a> toolkit and is designed to work well with visual GUI builders such as <a href="http://wxglade.sourceforge.net/">wxGlade</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/rfk/withrestart">withrestart</a> is Pythonisation of the restart-based condition system from Common List.  It's designed to make error recovery simpler and easier by removing the assumption that unhandled errors must be fatal.</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/rfk/threading2">threading2</a> is a drop-in replacement for the standard Python "threading" module, providing extended functionality such as thread priority and CPU affinity.</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/rfk/myppy">myppy</a> is a framework for building portable python distributions, currently targetting both Linux and Mac OS X.</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/rfk/m2wsgi">m2wsgi</a> is a WSGI gateway for the <a href="http://www.mongrel2.org/">Mongrel2</a> webserver.</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/rfk/pysidekick">PySideKick</a> is a collection of helpful utilities for building applications with <a href="http://www.pyside.org/">PySide</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/rfk/signedimp">signedimp</a> is a python <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0302/">import hook</a> for secure loading of cryptographically-signed code.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/rfk/django-paranoid-sessions">django-paranoid-sessions</a> is a Django plugin that makes login sessions work harder at preventing session-stealing attacks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Programs</h2>

<ul class="projects">
<li><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/proxylet/">proxylet</a> is a lightweight reverse proxy for HTTP, using non-blocking IO courtesy of <a href="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Eventlet">eventlet</a>.  It also features enough smarts to proxy to a subversion HTTP server at an arbitrary location, something which is surprisingly difficult to achieve since subversion uses absolute URLs in its HTTP-based protocol.
</ul>

<h2>Miscellanea</h2>

<ul class="projects">
<li><a href="https://github.com/rfk/withhacks">withhacks</a> is a suite of building blocks for hacking Python's "with" statement.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rfk/promise">promise</a> is a set of bytecode hacks to optimize Python code based on staticness assertions.</li>
<li>A collection of useful <a href="http://www.djangosnippets.org/users/rfk/">Django snippets</a> I have written.</li>
<li><a href="http://rfk.github.com/jquery-loadinline/">jquery-loadinline</a> is a <a href="http://www.jquery.com/">jQuery</a> plugin that makes links and forms load their contents into an existing page element.  Since it automatically applies itself recursively to any loaded content, the overall effect is like a little mini browser window contained within an element of the current page.</li>
<li><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/autoself/">autoself</a> is a Python module that uses bytecode hackery to automagically insert the "self" argument in method definitions.  It's just a technology exercise and should never be used by anyone...</li>
<li><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/wxAnyThread/">wxAnyThread</a> is a simple decorator for use with <a href="http://www.wxpython.org/">wxPython</a>, that allows functions and methods to be safely called from any thread.  It is basically a convenient wrapper around PostEvent that transparently dispatches the function call to the main thread.</li>
