  <p>I need something new in my career.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong.  I love what I do and I've no intention of abandoning the tech
scene to, say, <a href="http://www.snpp.com/episodes/5F20">start an emu farm</a>.
But the current combination of work, family and life in general is starting to wear us
all down.  It's time for a change.</p>
<p>And frankly, if you're going to make a change, you might as well make it the absolute
best one you can.  So for the duration of this post I'm going to try something rather
difficult – I'm going to switch off my usual unassuming, undemanding nature and
give myself permission to be greedy.  What's my dream job?  My serious, no-holds-barred,
anything-is-possible dream job.  Hopefully I don't come off sounding like an arrogant
jerk.</p>
<p>Because I need to know: does it exist, and do I have what it takes to land it?</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h3 id="the-dream">The Dream</h3>
<p>I want to be <strong>challenged</strong>.  I want to hack with world-class developers and grow
to be one myself.  I want the opportunity to learn and to teach every day.  I want to
be part of a team that <strong>loves their code</strong> and <strong>loves their job</strong>.</p>
<p>I don't want to be tied to a big-city office.  I want to raise my kids in a nice town
in rural Victoria.  I want take a working road trip up the coast to see my family and
friends in Queensland.  I want to take my wife to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningaloo_Reef">Ningaloo</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakadu_National_Park">Kakadu</a>.  Basically, I want a job that I can <strong>take with me</strong> and do from anywhere.
Or at least anywhere with broadband.</p>
<p>I want to write <strong>code that matters</strong>.</p>
<p>I want a company that respects <strong>open source</strong>.  That encourages community involvement
and knows how to leverage the global software pool to everyone's mutual benefit.  That has
sensible IP policies about projects I work on in my own time.</p>
<p>I want <strong>flexibility</strong>.  I want to start late if we've had a rough night with a
child.  I want to start early if there's an idea I can't get out of my head.  Once in a
while I want to cram the work week into four days and spend a long weekend doing something
with the family.  And I want confidence that not only will I get the job done, but
I'll get it done <em>well</em>.</p>
<p>I want a company that would accept a <a href="http://github.com/rfk/">github page</a>
as a resume and a <a href="./">blog post</a> as a cover letter.</p>
<p>And as long as my family isn't left wanting, I can give my kids the opportunities
they deserve, and I don't feel under-appreciated, then all of these things are more
important to me than the figure on the paycheck.</p>
<h3 id="the-pitch">The Pitch</h3>
<p>That sounds like a tall order.  But surely there must be a job out there that
fits my version of the dream, and I believe that I'd be perfect for it.  Here's why.</p>
<p>I'm a <strong>smart</strong> guy.  Ugh.  I hate putting it so bluntly, especially since &quot;smart&quot;
counts for so little on its own.  But this is a pitch after all, and I do have the
<a href="/about/cv.html#education">creds</a> to back it up.</p>
<p>I'm <strong>determined</strong>.  I believe that almost any problem can be solved with the right
combination of creativity and brute force.  Here's just one example:  when I was unhappy
that a frozen python application was far too large, I spent two days writing a tool to 
<a href="/blog/entry/hatchet-hack-frozen-pyside-apps/">hack dead code from the GUI library</a>
and cut over 40MB off the final size of the application.</p>
<p>I'm <strong>passionate</strong>.  About good code, good coding, and good developers.  I am always
striving to improve my <a href="http://www.rfk.id.au/blog/entry/testing-better-coverage-tox/">
development practices</a>.  I love to <a href="https://github.com/rfk">share my code</a>
and be part of a thriving developer community.</p>
<p>I'm <strong>omnivorous</strong>.  Lately I have been specialising in Python and JavaScript,
but I'm just as at home flipping bits in C, pruning search trees in Prolog,
or doing <a href="http://www.rfk.id.au/blog/entry/forking-ec2-instances-mozart-oz/">
distributed problem solving</a> with Mozart/Oz.  On my most recent freelance gig,
I found good cause to work some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-first_search">
classical AI techniques</a> into an otherwise standard Django-based website](None).</p>
<p>I'm <strong>articulate</strong>.  I like to write and I love to talk.  I'm as comfortable
<a href="http://blip.tv/pycon-australia/esky-keep-your-frozen-apps-fresh-3859194">demonstrating a new API</a> as I am <a href="http://www.rfk.id.au/ramblings/CAE_be_free.html">discussing
social issues in engineering</a>.  Lately I've been something of a fixture at the
<a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/MelbournePUG">Melbourne Python Users Group</a> and
I love the feeling of connecting and sharing with a group of like-minded developers.</p>
<p>Finally, I'm <strong>pragmatic</strong>.  I don't expect this dream job to fall into my lap.  But
by putting this up here, I do hope to hear about some interesting opportunities that I can
set myself toward pursuing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Do you work in a job like this?  Please, share your story in the comments or by <a href="/about/">email</a>.  I'd love to hear about how its working out for you, and whether it's
the good life I imagine it to be.</p>
<p>Do you know a company that offers opportunities like this?  Please, point me in their
direction.</p>
<p>Even better, are you a company looking to hire someone like me?  I've got
<a href="/about/cv.html">ten years experience</a> from academia to
engineering to the web; a <a href="http://github.com/rfk/">big stack of code</a> that I'm
proud to have written; and a burning desire to combine an awesome career in software with
a happy family and a balanced life. Please, <a href="/about/">let's talk</a>.</p>
