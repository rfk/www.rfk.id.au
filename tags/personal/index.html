      <p>It's well past time that I admitted something to myself: I am no longer actively maintaining any of my personal open-source projects.</p>
<p>As I was staring at my inbox this morning,
noticing that it was full of github issue reports
and thinking &quot;I should really make time to respond to those&quot;
and then feeling ashamed that some are now several months old,
I came to a surprising realisation –
it's not that I can't make time to maintain those projects these days,
it's that I <em>no longer want to</em>.
I'm not &quot;busy with family stuff&quot; like I've been in the habit of telling myself,
and I won't &quot;get to that sometime soon&quot;.
I'm getting my software fix on the job and I'm spending my personal time on other things,
and I'm surprised to find myself OK with that.</p>

      <p>It's been two months since I posted <a href="/blog/entry/seeking-dream-job/">Passionate Developer seeks Dream Job</a>, and I've been overwhelmed by the positive response it has generated - lots of well wishes, kind words, advice, and several really interesting opportunities.  Even better, I'm happy to announce that the story has a happy ending.</p>
<p>The short version: I started today with <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>, working as a contractor with the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Services">Services</a> team.  It's been quite a ride to get here, so read on if you're interested in the long-version debrief.</p>

      <p>I need something new in my career.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong.  I love what I do and I've no intention of abandoning the tech
scene to, say, <a href="http://www.snpp.com/episodes/5F20">start an emu farm</a>.
But the current combination of work, family and life in general is starting to wear us
all down.  It's time for a change.</p>
<p>And frankly, if you're going to make a change, you might as well make it the absolute
best one you can.  So for the duration of this post I'm going to try something rather
difficult – I'm going to switch off my usual unassuming, undemanding nature and
give myself permission to be greedy.  What's my dream job?  My serious, no-holds-barred,
anything-is-possible dream job.  Hopefully I don't come off sounding like an arrogant
jerk.</p>
<p>Because I need to know: does it exist, and do I have what it takes to land it?</p>

      <p>Following up on the previous post about <a href="/blog/entry/ergonomic-office-keyboard">my newly ergonomic office</a>, it's about time I shared all the details of my spiffy new chair. I've had it in heavy use for over a month now so I figure I can give a fair and unbiased opinion.</p>
<p>The short story: it's the <a href="https://www.steelcase.com/products/office-chairs/leap/">Steelcase Leap Chair</a> and it is made from pure awesomeness.</p>
<p>Now, the obvious choice for a programmer's office chair would have been that eternal symbol of dot-com-era excess, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeron_chair">Herman-Miller Aeron</a>.  Based solely on the hype the Aeron has generated online, any self-respecting chair-hunting geek owes it to themselves to track one down and try it out.  I managed to find some in-stock at <a href="http://www.livingedge.com.au/catalog/home.php">Living Edge</a> in Richmond, and having tried it out, fiddled with all the knobs and rolled it around the showroom floor, I have to say: Meh.  I just don't get the hype.  Sure, it's nicer than my old $60 chair from Officeworks, but at just shy of fifteen hundred bucks I was expecting a lot more.

      <p>I've been sitting on this news for a few weeks now, while I got all the final preparations taken care of.  I sent it off to the binders yesterday so I guess I can come clean: my PhD thesis has been accepted, and I'll soon be officially known as &quot;Dr Kelly&quot;.  Has a nice ring to it, don't you think? :-)</p>
<p>A special thanks to <a href="http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/%7Eadrian/">Adrian</a> for being a great supervisor over the past four years, it's been a very challenging and rewarding experience and I enjoyed the process immensely.  I've updated the page on <a href="/research/">my research</a> with a PDF version of <a href="/research/thesis/rfk-thesis.pdf">Asynchronous Multi-Agent Reasoning in the Situation Calculus</a>.  Hopefully I've found and updated all the other sections that said &quot;my thesis is currently under examination&quot; – please let me know if you spot any more.

      <p>Since I am now spending the vast majority of my time working out of the home office, I decided to invest a little cash in taking care of two of a programmer's most valuable assets – my wrists and back. I've been using my new acquisitions for a few weeks now so it's about time I reported on the experience.
