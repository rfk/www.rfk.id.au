  <h1>Curriculum Vitae of Ryan Francis Kelly</h1>
  <div class="item-meta">
    
  </div>

  <p>I am a software engineer and occasional consultant.  I live in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverloch,_Victoria">seaside town of Inverloch</a> near Melbourne, Australia,
where I work remotely as a Senior Staff Software Engineer for <a href="https://www.mozilla.com/">Mozilla</a>.</p>
<p>The best way to contact me is by email; use <code>ryan@</code> plus the domain of this website.</p>
<p>Professionally, I have worked as a software engineer for over a decade. I have substantial experience with Python, JavaScript, and Rust, but will confidently dabble in just about any language.
I've worked at scale across the stack, from back-end services to webapps to native clients, and have even spent a few years in management. I've found that regardless of language or platform, nothing beats the satisfaction of working with good people to ship code that you're proud of, and watching it make a difference to your users.</p>
<p>Academically, I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the Intelligent Agents Laboratory at the University of Melbourne. My undergraduate studies were a double bachelor's degree in Engineering and Computer Science, which I was awarded with first class honours.</p>
<p>Personally, I enjoy public speaking, theatre and performance arts of any persuasion.  I am a keen hiker and camper, even though it means being disconnected from the Internet for hours or even days at a time.</p>

## <a name="skills" />Skills

I dislike playing buzzword bingo, and am a big believer in cultivating a "T-shaped" skillset - having both a broad base of general knowledge, and the ability to dig in deep on something on demand.

Still, this *is* a CV, so here are a selection of skills that I've had the opportunity to dig in deep on in the past:

### Python

Python is currently my language of choice for general-purpose development, as shown by its prevalence among my current <a href="https://github.com/rfk/">open-source software projects</a>.  Like many Pythonistas, I appreciate the language's simplicity and its elegant conceptual model.  I've come to depend on Python's comprehensive standard library and the great variety of software available on the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/">Python Package Index</a> to get things done quickly and easily.

Some of my more popular open-source Python projects include:
* <a href="https://github.com/rfk/esky/">Esky</a>:  an auto-update framework for frozen Python apps.
* <a href="https://github.com/rfk/pypyjs">PyPy.js</a>:  a javascript backend and JIT target for the PyPy python interpreter.
* <a href="https://github.com/rfk/playitagainsam">playitagainsam</a>:  a presentation tool for recording and replaying live terminal sessions.


### JavaScript and Node.js

JavaScript was the first programming language I ever learned and I have been using it sporadically for over ten years.  The rise of node.js in recent years has seen me deploying it on both client and server (and occasionally typing "===" into my python code when I jump between projects).  Aside from the obvious list of warts, I find JavaScript to be very powerful and highly productive language.

Some of my more popular open-source JavaScript projects include:
* <a href="https://github.com/rfk/playitagainsam-js">playitagainsam-js</a>:  a web-based player for recorded terminal sessions.
* <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/awsboxen">awsboxen</a>:  a node.js deployment tool built on Amazon Cloud Formation.
* <a href="http://github.com/rfk/xmlns/">jquery.xmlns</a>:  a jQuery plugin providing CSS-3 namespace selector syntax.

### Rust

Recently learned, really enjoying. Wrote a bindings generator.

### Identity, Authentication and OAuth

I built an identity system.

### Cryptography

I'm not a cryptographer, but I've worked with some! Interfacing between cryptographic design and code.


### Written Communication

Constantly getting better at it.

### Public Speaking

Love it, have done a lot of it.

<h2 id="personal-interests"><a name="personal"></a> Personal Interests</h2>
<p>I enjoy tech conferences in both a personal and professional capacity, and have volunteered on the managing committee for <a href="https://pycon-au.org/">PyCon Au</a> on several occasions. Most recently I served as PyCon Au Treasurer for the 2016 and 2017 conferences.</p>
<p>I love public speaking and the performing arts in general. As a younger man I had major roles in several amateur theatrical/musical productions; as a busy working parent I look forward to fitting such things into my schedule again one day in the future.</p>
<p>I am a keen hiker and keen-if-the-weather-looks-good camper, and enjoy regular outdoor escapes with family and friends, even if it means being disconnected from the Internet for days at a time.
(Besides, have you <em>seen</em> all the tech gear you can get for camping these days?).</p>
